                    <h3>The Social Model vs. The Medical Model of Disability</h3>
                    <p>How we perceive disability fundamentally shapes our approach to care. It's crucial for paramedics to understand the shift from a medical to a social model.</p>
                    <table>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th>Medical Model</th>
                                <th>Social Model</th>

                                <td>Views disability as a health condition or problem residing within the individual. The person is seen as 'abnormal' and in need of being 'fixed' or cured.</td>
                                <td>Views disability as the result of the interaction between a person's impairment and societal barriers (physical, attitudinal, social). The problem is the inaccessible environment, not the person.</td>

                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Impairment vs. Disability:</strong> Under the social model, an <strong>impairment</strong> is the medical condition (e.g., inability to walk), while <strong>disability</strong> is the restriction created by society (e.g., a building with only stairs and no ramp).</p>

                <div class="practice-box">
                    <h3>Language and Ableism</h3>
                    <p>Language matters. Ableism is the discrimination against people with disability. Using respectful language is a key part of providing safe and person-centered care.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Person-First vs. Identity-First Language:</strong> Both are used. "People with disability" is person-first. "Disabled people" is identity-first, often preferred by those who see their disability as an integral part of their identity. The key is to respect individual preference.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Euphemisms:</strong> Terms like 'special needs' or 'differently-abled' are often considered condescending.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Negative Framing:</strong> Do not use terms like 'sufferer' or 'victim'. A person "has a condition" or "uses a wheelchair."</li>

                    <p>According to the 2022 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>21%</strong> of Australians (5.5 million people) live with a disability.</li>
                        <li>The likelihood of disability increases with age; 52% of Australians with a disability are aged 65 and over.</li>
                        <li>People with a disability face significant economic disparity, with a median personal income almost half that of people without a disability.</li>

                    <h3>What is Autism?</h3>
                    <p>Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition present from birth, characterized by the "dyad of impairments":</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Challenges with social communication and interaction.</li>
                        <li>Restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities, including sensory differences.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>It is a spectrum, and the DSM-5 uses "severity levels" (Levels 1, 2, and 3) based on the level of support a person requires. Avoid using outdated and harmful terms like "high/low functioning." Instead, refer to a person's <strong>support needs</strong>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-box">
                    <h3>Key Considerations for Paramedic Practice</h3>
                    <p>Acute healthcare settings are inherently challenging for autistic individuals due to the disruption of routine, sensory overload, and communication difficulties.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Communication:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>The Double Empathy Problem:</strong> Communication is a two-way street. Difficulties in communication are not solely the 'fault' of the autistic person but a mismatch in communication styles. It is the paramedic's responsibility to adapt.</li>
                                <li><strong>Strategies:</strong> Don't just talk to the carer; involve the person directly. Allow extra processing time. Use clear, concise language. Use visual supports (drawings, gestures) where possible.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Sensory Differences:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sensory input (lights, sirens, touch, sounds) can be experienced with much greater intensity and may be distressing or painful.</li>
                                <li><strong>Interoception</strong> (the sense of the internal state of the body) can be different, meaning a person may not be able to tell you where or how something hurts. Pain scales are often problematic.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stimming</strong> (self-stimulatory behavior) is a form of self-regulation and should not be stopped unless it is causing harm.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Challenging behaviors are often a response to sensory overload, anxiety, or an inability to communicate pain or distress. It's a matter of <strong>"can't do" vs. "won't do."</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>Diagnostic Overshadowing:</strong> Be wary of attributing a physical health problem to a person's disability. As seen in the case of Oliver McGowan and the Tasmanian boy 'HB', assuming a behavior is a 'panic attack' or 'just their autism' can be fatal. Always perform and trust your basic observations.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <h3>Strategies for a Safer Encounter</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Reduce Sensory Overload:</strong> Dim lights, turn off sirens when safe, reduce unnecessary noise, ask before touching.</li>
                        <li><strong>Be Predictable:</strong> Explain what you are going to do before you do it. Use a calm, steady tone of voice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Visuals:</strong> Show them the equipment. Draw pictures to explain what is happening.</li>
                        <li><strong>Listen to the Expert:</strong> The carer or the person themselves are the experts on their needs. Ask them: "What are the five most important things I need to know about you/them?"</li>

                    <p>The Alharthy et al. (2023) study highlights the significant challenges paramedics face when caring for patients with hearing or visual impairments. These communication breakdowns can lead to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Misinterpretation of patient history.</li>
                        <li>Underdiagnosis of conditions.</li>

                        <li>Increased risk of preventable adverse events.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Paramedics in the study reported that taking a medical history and explaining procedures were the biggest challenges. While many felt confident, this confidence was strongly associated with having received specific training.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Students felt their formal university training did not adequately prepare them for communicating with non-verbal children.</li>
                        <li>The placement developed crucial non-technical skills: <strong>empathy, patience, genuineness, and the ability to listen non-verbally and build trust quickly.</strong></li>
                        <li>Students gained a deeper understanding of 'difference' in all people, not just those with disabilities, and suggested placements with other marginalized groups.</li>
                        <li>Interestingly, students initially reported more negative attitudes on the IDP scale post-placement. This may reflect an initial 'culture shock' and anxiety, highlighting that short placements can be confronting and that longer, supported experiences are needed to move from discomfort to competence.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This reinforces the need to move beyond traditional ambulance placements to provide students with the skills and empathy required to care for the entire community.</p>
