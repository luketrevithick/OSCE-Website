                    <p>Family, domestic, and sexual violence (FDSV) is a major public health issue in Australia.</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>1 in 4 women</strong> and <strong>1 in 7 men</strong> have experienced emotional abuse from a partner since age 15.</li>
                        <li>Women are overwhelmingly the victims of intimate partner violence, while men are more likely to experience violence from strangers in public.</li>

                <div class="concept-box">
                    <h3>Who is Most at Risk?</h3>
                    <p>While FDSV occurs across all demographics, some groups face a significantly higher risk due to a combination of social, cultural, and systemic factors. <strong>Intersectionality</strong> means these factors often overlap, creating compounded vulnerability.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key At-Risk Groups:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Children and Young People:</strong> In 2022-23, over 180,000 children came into contact with child protection services. Emotional abuse and neglect are the most common primary types.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples:</strong> Are overrepresented as both victim-survivors and perpetrators. Family violence in this context must be understood as both a cause and effect of intergenerational trauma and systemic disadvantage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Young Women (15-34):</strong> Experience higher rates of physical and sexual intimate partner violence and sexual harassment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pregnant People:</strong> Pregnancy is a time of heightened risk for the onset or escalation of partner violence.</li>
                        <li><strong>People with Disability:</strong> Face increased vulnerability and barriers to seeking help.</li>
                        <li><strong>LGBTQIA+ People:</strong> May experience identity-based abuse (e.g., threats to "out" them) in addition to other forms of violence.</li>
                        <li><strong>People from CALD backgrounds:</strong> May face barriers such as visa status, language difficulties, and lack of culturally appropriate services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Older People (Elder Abuse):</strong> Vulnerability increases with age, cognitive impairment, and social isolation.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Scene Assessment:</strong> Paramedics can provide an unadulterated view of the scene, which is crucial information for other health and justice services.</li>
                        <li><strong>First Point of Contact:</strong> For many victim-survivors, the paramedic may be the first person they disclose to. Your response is critical.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Ambulance data (e.g., from NASS) is becoming increasingly important for understanding the prevalence and nature of FDSV in the community.</li>

                    <p>Elder abuse is any act within a relationship of trust that results in harm to an older person (typically >65 years, or >50 for First Nations peoples). It is often hidden and under-reported.</p>

                    <p><strong>Perpetrators:</strong> The majority of abuse is intergenerational, perpetrated by adult children, with sons more likely to be perpetrators than daughters.</p>

                    <h3>Risk Factors and Recognition</h3>
                    <p>Paramedics should have a high index of suspicion in the presence of key risk factors.</p>
                     <table>

                            <tr><td><strong>Cognitive Impairment</strong></td><td>Dementia or other cognitive disabilities significantly increase vulnerability.</td></tr>
                            <tr><td><strong>Social Isolation</strong></td><td>Lack of social networks makes the older person more vulnerable and makes abuse less likely to be discovered.</td></tr>
                            <tr><td><strong>Dependence</strong></td><td>When the older person is dependent on the perpetrator for care, or when the perpetrator (e.g., an adult child) is financially or emotionally dependent on the older person.</td></tr>
                            <tr><td><strong>History of Trauma</strong></td><td>A lifelong pattern of domestic violence can continue into older age.</td></tr>

                    <h3>Paramedic Response and Reporting</h3>
                    <p>Unlike child abuse, there is generally no mandatory reporting for elder abuse in Australia (except in government-funded aged care facilities). The response should be guided by the wishes of the competent older person.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Ensure Immediate Safety:</strong> Your first priority is the patient's immediate medical needs and safety.</li>
                        <li><strong>Private Conversation:</strong> If possible and safe, try to speak with the older person alone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Provide Support (LIVES):</strong> Use the LIVES model to listen, inquire, validate, enhance safety, and support.</li>
                        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Document your concerns and observations clearly and objectively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Referral:</strong> Provide information on elder abuse helplines and support services (e.g., Seniors Rights Service). In cases of immediate danger or criminal acts, police involvement is necessary.</li>
