                <div class="sociology-box">
                    <h3>What is "Home"?</h3>
                    <p>Before defining homelessness, it's crucial to understand "home." As Mallett (2004) outlines, home is a multidimensional concept, not just a physical structure. It includes feelings and practices related to:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                        <li><strong>Security & Stability:</strong> A sense of permanence and safety.</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy & Control:</strong> The ability to control your living space.</li>
                        <li><strong>Haven:</strong> A refuge from the outside world (critically, this is not true for victims of domestic violence, who may be "homeless at home").</li>
                        <li><strong>Identity:</strong> An expression of self.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="sociology-box">
                    <h3>Defining "Homelessness"</h3>
                    <p>Definitions are socially constructed and have evolved. The Chamberlain & Mackenzie (1992) model provides a comprehensive cultural framework based on "minimum community standards."</p>

                        <li><strong>Geography:</strong> The Northern Territory has the highest *rate* of homelessness (564 per 10,000), largely due to severe overcrowding. Victoria had the highest proportion living in boarding houses.</li>

                    <h3>Intersectionality and Co-occurring Disadvantage</h3>
                    <p>Intersectionality highlights that people are not just "homeless." They often belong to multiple vulnerable groups, and these co-occurring disadvantages create compounded health crises.</p>
                    <p>The study by Tweed et al. (2021) on co-occurring homelessness, imprisonment, substance use, sex work, and/or severe mental illness found that individuals with <strong>multiple exclusions experience profoundly worse health outcomes</strong> and higher mortality rates than those with only one. This requires a coordinated response from health, justice, and social services.</p>
                    <p><strong>Priority Populations at High Risk of Homelessness:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                        <li><strong>Women and Children (FDSV):</strong> Family and domestic violence is the leading cause of homelessness for this group. They often become "hidden homeless" (e.g., couch surfing).</li>
                        <li><strong>Children and Young People:</strong> Often homeless due to family breakdown, FDSV, and abuse. Youth homelessness is a strong predictor of adult homelessness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Indigenous Australians:</strong> Massively overrepresented (20% of the homeless population vs. 3.2% of the general population), largely due to systemic factors, intergenerational trauma, and severe overcrowding.</li>
                        <li><strong>People Exiting Institutions:</strong> High risk for people leaving prison or out-of-home care with no housing or support.</li>
                        <li><strong>Older People:</strong> A rapidly growing group, especially older women, due to low lifetime earnings, lack of savings, and major life disruptions (e.g., death of a partner).</li>
                        <li><strong>Veterans:</strong> An estimated 5.3% of transitioned veterans experience homelessness, linked to mental health, physical injury, and social isolation.</li>

                        <li><strong>Lower Acuity:</strong> Calls are often for psychiatric complaints, minor trauma, or "no medical complaint," rather than high-acuity medical issues. This can lead to bias.</li>
                        <li><strong>Barriers to Care:</strong> Patients face numerous barriers, including stigma, fear, and low health literacy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Referral Difficulty:</strong> The transient nature of homelessness makes follow-up and referrals to traditional primary care almost impossible.</li>

                        <li><strong>[H] Housing Precarity:</strong> Identify housing instability. This is a key clinical vital sign.</li>
                        <li><strong>[O] Outcomes of mental illness:</strong> Screen for and identify mental health issues and their impact.</li>
                        <li><strong>[U] Understanding income:</strong> Be aware of financial insecurity and income support.</li>
                        <li><strong>[S] Start case management for mental health:</strong> Initiate referrals to appropriate mental health and social support services.</li>
                        <li><strong>[E] Evaluate substance use:</strong> Assess for substance use and link to harm-reduction interventions.</li>

                    <h3>Practical Tips for Paramedics (from Davies & Wood, 2018)</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                        <li><strong>Awareness of Status:</strong> Be aware of the power dynamic and social differences. Simple advice on nutrition can feel judgemental to someone who cannot access food.</li>
                        <li><strong>Build Trust:</strong> Spend sufficient time to ensure the patient feels heard. This is key to future help-seeking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trauma-Informed Care:</strong> Assume the patient has a history of trauma. Physical examinations can be an invasion of privacy; only perform what is absolutely necessary and explain everything.</li>
                        <li><strong>Health Literacy:</strong> Lower literacy and cognitive impairment are common. Explain information clearly, simply, and use visual aids where possible.</li>
                        <li><strong>Refer:</strong> Connect patients to specialized services (e.g., Specialist Homelessness Services, AskIzzy) that can provide appropriate follow-up.</li>
