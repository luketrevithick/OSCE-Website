                    <ul>

                    <h3>Key Principles and Documents</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Doctrine of Double Effect:</strong> A core principle that legally and ethically protects clinicians. It states that an action with a good intention (e.g., relieving pain with morphine) is permissible even if it has a foreseeable but unintended negative effect (e.g., hastening death through respiratory depression). The <strong>intent</strong> must be to relieve suffering, not to end life.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advance Care Directives (ACDs):</strong> A legal document made by a person with capacity that outlines their preferences for future healthcare, including refusal of specific life-sustaining treatments. A valid ACD must be followed.</li>
                         <li><strong>Substitute Decision-Makers:</strong> When a patient loses capacity and has not appointed an Enduring Guardian, decisions are made by a "person responsible" according to a legal hierarchy (e.g., spouse, carer, relative).</li>
                        <li><strong>Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD):</strong> Now legal in all Australian states. It is a separate process with strict eligibility criteria and is distinct from palliative care and the doctrine of double effect. Paramedics must be aware of their role as defined by local legislation.</li>

                    <h3>Paediatric Palliative Care</h3>
                    <p>Providing palliative care to children is emotionally challenging and requires a family-centered approach. Families often prefer care at home to maintain normalcy and family connection. Paramedics may be called for symptom crises, planned transfers, or at the time of death.</p>
                    <p><strong>Family Experiences:</strong> The Winger et al. (2020) review found that families need organized, skilled support, respite care, support for siblings, and financial assistance. The ability to have care provided at home strengthens family life.</p>

                <div class="sociology-box">
                    <h3>Older People and Dementia</h3>
                    <p>Most deaths in older people occur in the context of chronic disease and frailty. Key challenges include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prognostication:</strong> It is difficult to identify a well-defined terminal phase, especially in dementia.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Challenges in assessing symptoms, particularly pain, in cognitively impaired patients.</li>
                        <li><strong>Under-treatment:</strong> The palliative care needs of older people, especially those in residential aged care, are often under-assessed and under-treated.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                 <div class="sociology-box">
                    <h3>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples</h3>
                    <p>Providing culturally safe palliative care is essential.</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Use plain language. Be aware that direct conversations about "death" may be culturally inappropriate; use terms like "finishing up." Ask who the patient wishes health matters to be discussed with, as decision-making is often communal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kinship and Country:</strong> Recognize the importance of extended family and the deep connection to Country. A person may wish to pass away on their traditional lands.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sorry Business:</strong> Understand that this is a period of mourning with specific cultural practices that must be respected.</li>
