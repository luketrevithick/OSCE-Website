                    <h3>Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology</h3>
                    <p>GORD is a chronic condition where stomach acid and other gastric contents persistently reflux into the oesophagus. The primary defect is a dysfunctional <strong>lower oesophageal sphincter (LES)</strong>. This dysfunction arises from two main mechanisms:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Decreased LES Tone:</strong> The sphincter muscle is abnormally relaxed, failing to maintain a barrier against reflux.</li>
                        <li><strong>Increased Intragastric Pressure:</strong> Conditions like obesity, pregnancy, or large meals increase pressure within the stomach, physically overcoming the sphincter's resistance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This chronic exposure of the oesophageal mucosa to acidic gastric contents leads to inflammation (<strong>reflux oesophagitis</strong>), which can cause cellular changes, fibrosis, and the formation of strictures (narrowing) over time.</p>

It is typically postprandial (after meals) and exacerbated by lying flat or bending over.<br><strong>Regurgitation:</strong> The effortless return of sour or bitter gastric contents into the mouth.</td>
                                <td>Persistent cough (especially at night), chronic sore throat, hoarseness, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and asthma-like symptoms (from micro-aspiration of acid).</td>

                        <li><strong>Focused History:</strong> Use SOCRATES to characterize the pain. Ask specifically about relationship to meals, posture, and response to antacids. A history of similar episodes more than once a week is suggestive of GORD.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exclude Cardiac Causes:</strong> This is the priority. A thorough cardiovascular assessment, including a 12-lead ECG, is mandatory to rule out ACS. Any suspicion of a cardiac cause requires management as per the relevant chest pain protocol.</li>
                        <li><strong>Symptomatic Treatment:</strong> If ACS is confidently excluded, management is supportive. Positioning the patient upright can provide relief. Analgesia may be considered.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disposition:</strong> Patients with suspected ACS require urgent transport. Patients with a clear history of GORD and typical, manageable symptoms may be suitable for a non-transport pathway with advice to see their GP.</li>

                <div class="disorder-box">
                    <h3>Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology</h3>
                    <p>An upper GI bleed is defined as bleeding originating from a source proximal to the Ligament of Treitz. Key causes include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD):</strong> An ulcer erodes through the mucosal wall and into an underlying artery or vein. This is often driven by <em>H. pylori</em> infection or chronic NSAID use, which disrupt the protective mucosal barrier of the stomach and duodenum.</li>
                        <li><strong>Oesophageal Varices:</strong> Chronic liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis from alcoholism) leads to <strong>portal hypertension</strong> (increased pressure in the portal venous system). This forces blood to be shunted into collateral vessels, including the veins at the gastro-oesophageal junction. These veins become engorged and fragile (varices) and can rupture under pressure, leading to catastrophic, high-volume haemorrhage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mallory-Weiss Tear:</strong> A longitudinal tear in the mucosa at the gastro-oesophageal junction caused by a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure, typically from forceful vomiting or retching.</li>

                    <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Gallstones form in the gallbladder when bile becomes supersaturated with cholesterol, which then precipitates out of solution to form solid stones. This is promoted by insufficient bile salts and gallbladder stasis (impaired emptying).</p>

                    <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Acute inflammation of the gallbladder wall, almost always caused by a gallstone becoming permanently impacted in the cystic duct. The obstruction leads to bile stasis, increased pressure, and chemical irritation, followed by inflammation and often secondary bacterial infection.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clinical Presentation:</strong> The patient presents with biliary colic that is persistent and more severe, accompanied by systemic signs of inflammation such as fever, tachycardia, and nausea. The key physical sign is a <strong>positive Murphy's sign</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas. It is triggered by an event (most commonly a gallstone obstructing the pancreatic duct, or excessive alcohol intake) that leads to the premature activation of digestive enzymes *within* the pancreatic acinar cells. These activated enzymes, particularly trypsin, begin to digest the pancreatic tissue itself (<strong>autodigestion</strong>). This process causes severe inflammation, cell necrosis, and can trigger a massive systemic inflammatory response, potentially leading to shock and multi-organ failure.</p>
