                    <p>ACS is a spectrum of conditions resulting from acute myocardial ischemia (inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle). It is most commonly caused by the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery. This rupture triggers platelet aggregation and thrombus (clot) formation, which partially or completely occludes the artery, leading to unstable angina, NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction), or STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction).</p>

                    <p>A life-threatening emergency caused by an acute, severe deficiency of cortisol (a glucocorticoid) and often aldosterone (a mineralocorticoid). This occurs in patients with known adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) or those on long-term steroid therapy who are exposed to a physiological stressor (e.g., infection, trauma) without an increase in their steroid dose. The lack of cortisol leads to an inability to maintain blood glucose and mount a stress response, while the lack of aldosterone causes sodium wasting and potassium retention, leading to severe hypovolemia, hypoglycemia, and shock.</p>
