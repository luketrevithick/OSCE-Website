                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Epidemiology of Pain Presentations</h3>
                <p>Pain is one of the most common reasons people call for an ambulance. In NSW, a significant portion of daily paramedic caseload involves managing patients with acute or chronic pain. Presentations range from traumatic injuries (fractures, burns) to medical conditions (cardiac pain, renal colic, headaches) and exacerbations of chronic pain (cancer pain, back pain).</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>OSCE Tip:</strong> In your assessment, always start with an open-ended question like, "Tell me about the pain you're experiencing." Then, use a structured tool like <strong class="font-bold">OPQRST</strong> (Onset, Provocation/Palliation, Quality, Radiation, Severity, Timing) or <strong class="font-bold">SOCRATES</strong> (Site, Onset, Character, Radiation, Associations, Time course, Exacerbating/Relieving factors, Severity) to gather a thorough history.
                </div>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Types of Pain & Physiology</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Nociceptive Pain:</strong> Caused by stimulation of nociceptors, which are sensory receptors for painful stimuli. It's the "normal" response to injury.
                        <ul class="list-decimal list-inside ml-6 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Somatic:</strong> Arises from bone, joint, muscle, skin, or connective tissue. Usually well-localised, described as aching, throbbing, or sharp. (e.g., fractured bone, burn).</li>
                            <li><strong>Visceral:</strong> Arises from internal organs. Often poorly localised and may be referred to other areas. Described as cramping, squeezing, or dull. (e.g., appendicitis, cardiac pain).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Neuropathic Pain:</strong> Caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. The pain signal is abnormal. Often described as burning, shooting, stabbing, or "pins and needles." (e.g., diabetic neuropathy, sciatica).</li>
                    <li><strong>Nociplastic Pain (Central Sensitisation):</strong> Pain that arises from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. The central nervous system becomes sensitised. (e.g., fibromyalgia).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600">The Pain Pathway</h3>
                <p>The journey of a pain signal involves four key physiological processes:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Transduction:</strong> A noxious stimulus (mechanical, thermal, chemical) is converted into an electrical signal (action potential) by a nociceptor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> The action potential is conducted along nerve fibres (A-delta fibres for sharp, fast pain; C-fibres for dull, slow pain) to the spinal cord. It then ascends via the spinothalamic tract to the brain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perception:</strong> The brain (thalamus, somatosensory cortex, limbic system) processes the signal, resulting in the conscious experience of pain. This is a subjective experience influenced by emotions, beliefs, and past experiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modulation:</strong> The brain and spinal cord can alter the pain signal. Descending pathways can release endogenous opioids (endorphins, enkephalins) and neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine) that inhibit pain transmission.</li>
                </ol>

            <!-- IV & IO Access Section -->
            <section id="iv-io">
                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">IV & IO Access</h2>
                <div class="cpg-ref">
                    <strong>CPG Reference:</strong> Always refer to the latest NSW Ambulance CPG for Vascular Access. Pay close attention to cannula size, site selection, and flushing procedures.
                </div>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Intravenous (IV) Cannulation Technique</h3>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-3">
                    <li><strong>BSI & Preparation:</strong> Standard precautions. Gather equipment: correct size cannula, tourniquet, alcohol wipe, dressing, flush, giving set. Prepare a saline flush.</li>
                    <li><strong>Site Selection:</strong> Choose a suitable vein. Start distally and work proximally. The antecubital fossa (ACF) is large but limits mobility. Dorsum of the hand and forearm are common sites. Avoid areas of infection, injury, or near joints where possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tourniquet Application:</strong> Apply 5-10cm above the chosen site. It should be tight enough to impede venous return but not arterial flow (check for a radial pulse).</li>
                    <li><strong>Vein Preparation:</strong> Clean the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds and allow to air dry completely. Do not re-palpate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cannulation:</strong> Anchor the vein by pulling the skin taut distally. Insert the cannula, bevel up, at a 15-30 degree angle. Observe for primary flashback in the cannula chamber.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advancement:</strong> Once flashback is seen, lower the angle and advance the cannula and needle a further few millimetres to ensure the cannula tip is in the vein. Then, withdraw the needle slightly while advancing the cannula fully into the vein.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure & Flush:</strong> Release the tourniquet. Occlude the vein proximal to the cannula tip, remove the needle, and attach the bung or giving set. Secure with a dressing. Flush with 5-10mL of Sodium Chloride 0.9% to confirm patency (check for swelling or pain).</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Intraosseous (IO) Cannulation Technique</h3>
                <p>IO access is a rapid, safe, and effective alternative when IV access is difficult or impossible in a critically ill patient.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-3">
                    <li><strong>BSI & Site Selection:</strong> Standard precautions. Identify landmarks for the chosen site. Common sites include:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Proximal Tibia:</strong> 2cm medial to the tibial tuberosity (in adults).</li>
                            <li><strong>Proximal Humerus:</strong> Palpate the surgical neck of the humerus.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Clean the site thoroughly with an antiseptic wipe.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insertion (using EZ-IO):</strong> Select the correct needle size based on tissue depth. Position the driver at a 90-degree angle to the bone. Push the needle through the skin until the tip touches bone. Ensure at least one black line is visible on the catheter. Squeeze the driver's trigger and apply gentle, steady pressure until you feel a "pop" or loss of resistance as the needle enters the medullary cavity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confirmation & Secure:</strong> Remove the driver and stylet. The needle should stand firm in the bone. Attach the extension set and aspirate for bone marrow (often not possible). Flush with 5-10mL of Sodium Chloride 0.9%. This will be met with resistance and may require a pressure bag. Secure the device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pain Management:</strong> IO infusion is painful. For conscious patients, consider administration of Lignocaine 1% (if within scope/protocol) prior to the main fluid infusion.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Decision Making: IV vs IO</h3>
                <p>The decision hinges on patient acuity and the difficulty of IV access.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>When to choose IV:</strong> The default for most patients requiring fluid or medication. Attempt IV access first unless the patient is in extremis.</li>
                    <li><strong>When to choose IO:</strong> Indicated in critically ill or injured patients when IV access is not readily obtainable.
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2">
                            <li>Cardiac arrest</li>
                            <li>Severe shock / profound hypotension</li>
                            <li>Status epilepticus</li>
                            <li>Major trauma</li>

                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>OSCE Tip:</strong> Verbalise your decision-making process. For example: "The patient is in cardiac arrest, and peripheral access is not available. Therefore, I will proceed with IO access at the proximal tibia to ensure rapid administration of drugs and fluids as per the cardiac arrest CPG."

                <p>Water moves between intracellular and extracellular compartments via osmosis, driven by the concentration of solutes. The goal of IV fluid therapy is to manipulate this balance to restore intravascular volume.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Isotonic Fluids (e.g., Sodium Chloride 0.9%, Hartmann's):</strong> Have a similar solute concentration to blood plasma. They primarily expand the intravascular space without causing significant fluid shifts in or out of cells. This is the mainstay of prehospital fluid resuscitation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypotonic Fluids (e.g., 0.45% NaCl):</strong> Have a lower solute concentration. They cause fluid to move from the intravascular space into the intracellular space, causing cells to swell. Rarely used in prehospital care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypertonic Fluids (e.g., 3% NaCl):</strong> Have a higher solute concentration. They draw fluid from the intracellular space into the intravascular space, causing cells to shrink. Used for specific conditions like traumatic brain injury with cerebral oedema.</li>

In trauma, aim for a systolic BP of ~90mmHg (permissive hypotension) to avoid "popping the clot." Always treat the underlying cause!

                <p>The primary survey (DRSABCD) always comes first. Once the patient is stable, focus on the injured limb.</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Look:</strong> Expose the limb. Look for deformity, swelling, bruising, open wounds (compound fracture).</li>
                    <li><strong>Feel:</strong> Gently palpate along the bone away from the point of maximal pain, moving towards it. Feel for tenderness, crepitus (do not deliberately elicit this), and temperature changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Move:</strong> Assess active and passive range of motion ONLY if the patient can tolerate it and there is no gross deformity. If a fracture is obvious, do not ask the patient to move the limb.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neurovascular Assessment (The 6 P's):</strong> This is critical to assess limb viability. Compare the injured limb to the uninjured one.
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Pain:</strong> Out of proportion to the injury (a key sign of compartment syndrome).</li>
                            <li><strong>Pallor:</strong> Pale or mottled skin suggests poor arterial supply.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pulselessness:</strong> Check distal pulses (e.g., radial, dorsalis pedis). Use a Doppler if necessary.</li>
                            <li><strong>Paraesthesia:</strong> Numbness or tingling suggests nerve involvement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Paralysis:</strong> Inability to move digits or the limb suggests nerve or muscle damage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Perishingly Cold (Poikilothermia):</strong> The limb feels cold to the touch.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <strong>Complications:</strong> A neurovascularly compromised limb is a surgical emergency. Other complications include haemorrhage (especially with femur fractures), compartment syndrome (swelling in a closed muscle compartment cuts off blood supply), and fat embolism.

                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-3">
                    <li><strong>Gain Consent & Provide Analgesia:</strong> Explain the procedure clearly. Provide Methoxyflurane or Fentanyl as needed. The patient needs to be relaxed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Position the patient supine or semi-recumbent. The key is to relax the quadriceps muscle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technique:</strong> While the patient is relaxed, slowly and gently extend the knee. As the knee approaches full extension, the patella will often spontaneously relocate. If it does not, apply gentle, steady medial pressure to the lateral edge of the patella to guide it back into the trochlear groove.</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-Reduction Care:</strong> Reassess neurovascular status. Immobilise the knee in extension or slight flexion using a splint. Transport for further assessment and imaging.</li>

                <p>A life-threatening condition in patients with a spinal cord injury at or above T6. A noxious stimulus below the level of injury (e.g., full bladder, bowel impaction) causes an imbalanced sympathetic response.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> The noxious stimulus sends signals up the spinal cord which are blocked at the level of injury. This triggers a massive, uncontrolled sympathetic discharge below the injury, causing severe vasoconstriction and hypertension. The brain detects the hypertension and tries to slow the heart rate via the vagus nerve (bradycardia) and cause vasodilation above the injury, but the signal can't get past the lesion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Signs & Symptoms:</strong> Pounding headache, severe acute hypertension (SBP >200mmHg), bradycardia, flushing and sweating above the level of injury, pale/cool skin below the injury.</li>

                            <li><strong>Manage Hypertension:</strong> If BP remains dangerously high after initial measures, pharmacological intervention is needed. Follow local CPGs, which may include Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN).</li>

                    <li><strong>Ischaemic Stroke (~85%):</strong> A clot (thrombus or embolus) blocks a cerebral artery. This is the most common type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Haemorrhagic Stroke (~15%):</strong> A blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing bleeding into or around the brain tissue.

                            <li><strong>Intracerebral Haemorrhage:</strong> Bleeding within the brain tissue itself.</li>
                            <li><strong>Subarachnoid Haemorrhage:</strong> Bleeding into the space between the brain and the meninges, often from a ruptured aneurysm. Presents with a "thunderclap" headache.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA):</strong> "Mini-stroke" where symptoms resolve completely, usually within an hour. It's a major warning sign for a future stroke.</li>

                            <li><strong>Type 2:</strong> Partial flap loss. The flap cannot cover the entire wound.</li>
                            <li><strong>Type 3:</strong> Total flap loss. The entire skin flap is gone.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Pressure Ulcers:</strong> Classified in stages based on depth of tissue damage. High-risk patients are immobile, have poor nutrition, and have sensory impairment.</li>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-600">Wound Dressing & Aseptic Technique</h3>
                <p>The goal is to prevent infection and promote healing. An aseptic non-touch technique (ANTT) is used.</p>
                <p><strong>Cleaning and Dressing a Skin Tear (e.g., Type 1 or 2):</strong></p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-3">
                    <li><strong>BSI & Consent:</strong> Standard precautions. Explain the procedure. Provide analgesia if needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare Field:</strong> Open the dressing pack to create a sterile field.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Use gauze soaked in Sodium Chloride 0.9% to gently clean the wound and surrounding skin. Pat dry carefully.</li>
                    <li><strong>Realign Flap:</strong> If there is a skin flap, gently realign it back into place using a moistened cotton bud or forceps. Do not stretch it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Select Dressing:</strong> For a skin tear, a non-adherent silicone-based dressing is ideal as it won't damage the fragile skin upon removal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply Dressing:</strong> Apply the primary dressing. Secure with a bandage, not tape, to avoid further skin damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document:</strong> Document the assessment, procedure, and dressing used. Advise the patient/carer on when the dressing should be checked.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-600">Disposition and Closure</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>When is prehospital closure suitable?</strong> Only for simple, clean lacerations with well-approximated edges. Steri-strips are a common method. Follow local CPGs.</li>
                    <li><strong>When to refer for closure?</strong> Wounds that are deep, contaminated, involve specialised areas (face, hands), or show signs of neurovascular compromise require formal closure and assessment in a hospital or GP clinic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disposition:</strong> A patient with a simple, well-dressed wound may be suitable for self-care or GP follow-up. A patient with a complicated wound, high risk of infection (e.g., diabetic patient with a foot wound), or uncontrolled bleeding requires transport to the ED.</li>
