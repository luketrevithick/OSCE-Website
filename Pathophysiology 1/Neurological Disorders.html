    <h1>Neurology Overview</h1>

    ---

    <h2>I. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>TBI is defined as "an injury to the head/brain by external mechanical force, often resulting in impairment of consciousness and sometimes other neurological signs/symptoms."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A. Causes and Epidemiology</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Main Causes:</b> Falls, motor vehicle accidents, attempted suicides, interpersonal violence, sporting/recreational, and workplace accidents.</li>
        <li><b>Demographics:</b> "Almost 80% of TBIs occur in males."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Types of TBI</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Closed/Blunt TBI (More Common):</b> Head striking a hard surface or a rapidly moving object striking the head.</li>
        <li><b>Penetrating TBI:</b> Occurs when an object penetrates the skull and brain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Impaired Consciousness and Assessment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mechanism:</b> Implies "diffuse brain injury to the RAS in the brainstem at any level or both cerebral hemispheres simultaneously." Local brain injury typically causes focal deficits without disrupting consciousness unless intracranial pressure (ICP) significantly increases.</li>
        <li><b>Reticular Activating System (RAS):</b> A "complex network of neurons that connects brainstem reticular formation... with nonspecific thalamic nuclei, the hypothalamus, and the cerebral cortex." It's "thought to have essential role in controlling arousal and awareness of oneself and the environment."</li>
        <li><b>Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS):</b> A clinical tool for assessing level of consciousness (LOC) in brain injury. Scores are given for eye opening, motor, and verbal responses (E + M + V).
            <ul>
                <li>Best possible score: 15</li>
                <li>Worst possible score: 3</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Posturing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Decorticate Posturing:</b> "Flexion of the elbows, wrists, and fingers with adduction at the shoulders. The lower limbs show extension and internal rotation at the hip, with the extension of the knees and plantar flexion of the feet."</li>
        <li><b>Decerebrate Posturing:</b> "Adduction and internal rotation of the shoulders, extension of the elbows, pronation of the forearms, and flexion of the wrists and fingers. The lower limbs show extension and internal rotation at the hips, with the extension of the knees and plantar flexion of the feet." This often indicates more severe brainstem damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>E. Specific TBI Types</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Concussion (Mild Traumatic Brain Injury - MTBI):</b> "A blow to the head disrupts the normal functioning of the brain (temporary axonal disturbance) with some damage of neuronal cell membranes, but without gross pathologic changes."
            <ul>
                <li><b>Clinical Features:</b> Confusion, disorientation, amnesia, headache, dizziness, nausea, balance issues, visual disturbances, sensitivity to light/noise, and personality/emotional changes.</li>
                <li><b>Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS):</b> Symptoms lasting weeks to months.</li>
                <li><b>Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE):</b> Associated with "neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex and substantia nigra of the midbrain similar to Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI):</b> "A type of traumatic brain injury that can occur from a blunt injury to the head" due to "rapidly accelerated or decelerated" forces.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Pathology:</b> "Disruption and disintegration of axons in white matter without visible macroscopic brain lesions."</li>
                <li><b>Diagnosis:</b> Primarily clinical, with "very little imaging evidence identified on brain CT and MRI."</li>
                <li><b>Outcome:</b> Produces "loss of consciousness of variable depth and duration."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Cerebral Contusion:</b> "Bruising of the brain tissue" from head trauma. Can occur at the "site of impact (coup injury) or on the opposite side (contrecoup injury)."</li>
        <li><b>Cerebral Laceration:</b> "Following a penetration of the brain by a sharp object, projectile or bony fragments after skull fracture." Can also occur without penetration in severe acceleration/deceleration injuries, affecting inferior frontal and temporal lobes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>F. Intracranial Pressure (ICP)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "Pressure inside the skull and thus in the brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid."</li>
        <li><b>Monro-Kellie Hypothesis:</b> States that the total intracranial volume (brain, CSF, blood, lesion) is constant within the rigid skull. Normal ICP is <15mm Hg.</li>
        <li><b>Herniation Syndromes:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cingulate (Subfalcine):</b> Cingulate gyrus shifts under the falx cerebri.</li>
                <li><b>Central:</b> Downward shift of diencephalon through the tentorium cerebelli.</li>
                <li><b>Uncal (Transtentorial):</b> Parahippocampal gyrus uncus shifts through the tentorium cerebelli notch.</li>
                <li><b>Tonsillar:</b> Cerebellar tonsils shift down through the foramen magnum.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Common Clinical Manifestations of Increased ICP:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Headache</li>
                <li>Vomiting (often 'projectile')</li>
                <li>Decreased level of consciousness (confusion, drowsiness, stupor/coma)</li>
                <li>Papilloedema (swelling of optic nerve disc)</li>
                <li>Pupillary dilation (one or both sides)</li>
                <li><b>Cushing’s Triad:</b> "Increased systolic BP, bradycardia and abnormal breathing."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

                <li>Cannot understand spoken/written language. Speech is "fluent, effortless and well-articulated, often with long sentences but has many paraphrasias (word substitutions that are wrong) and neologisms (made-up words); speech is devoid of meaning and can be totally incomprehensible (‘word salad’)." Patients are "typically unaware of their mistakes."</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>B. Corticospinal Tracts (Pyramidal Tracts)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Function:</b> "Voluntary control of limbs muscles, especially fine movements."</li>
        <li><b>Lateral Corticospinal Tract (90%):</b> Crosses over in pyramidal decussation, innervates contralateral muscles.</li>
        <li><b>Anterior Corticospinal Tract (10%):</b> Some axons cross at spinal segment level, others don't, innervate ipsilateral muscles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Spinal Sensory Pathways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Spinothalamic Tract:</b> Transmits pain, temperature, crude touch. Crosses over in the spinal cord, ascends contralaterally.</li>
        <li><b>Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscus System:</b> Transmits discriminative touch, conscious proprioception. Ascends ipsilaterally to medulla, then crosses to contralateral thalamus.</li>
        <li><b>Brown-Sequard’s Syndrome:</b> Hemisection of the spinal cord.

    <ul>
        <li><b>Reflexive Control:</b> Parasympathetic centers in S2-S4.</li>
        <li><b>Lesions Above Sacral Cord (UMN Bladder):</b> Interrupt ascending sensory and descending control. Intact sacral reflex leads to "hypertonic, hyper-reflexive bladder and increased tone of the external sphincter (detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia)." Results in "reduced bladder filling capacity (spastic bladder), high pressures... but reflexive uncontrolled emptying can occur automatically."</li>
        <li><b>Lesions Affecting S2-S4 Segments (LMN Bladder):</b> No conscious sensation, no voluntary control, and no bladder emptying reflexes. Leads to "hypotonic (flaccid) bladder, which is distended (overfilled with urine) and is constantly leaking small amounts of urine (incontinence, overflow dribbling)."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>F. Bowel Function in SCIs (Neurogenic Bowel)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Lesions Above Sacral Cord (UMN Bowel):</b> No awareness of rectal fullness, no voluntary external anal sphincter control. Hypertonic smooth muscle and sphincter. "Tendency for faecal retention and constipation, but rectal stretch can still intermittently elicit reflexive uncontrolled emptying."</li>
        <li><b>Sacral SCIs Affecting S2-S4 (LMN Bowel):</b> No awareness, no voluntary control, and loss of emptying reflexes. "Hypotonic bowel with chronic constipation with risk of incontinence due to flaccid paralysis of external anal sphincter."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>G. Sexual Function in SCIs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Components:</b> Psychogenic (T11-L2 sympathetic) and reflexogenic (S2-S4 parasympathetic).</li>
        <li><b>Complete SCIs:</b> Loss of conscious sensation from genitals.</li>
        <li><b>SCIs L2-S1:</b> Preserved reflexogenic arousal, incomplete psychogenic.</li>
        <li><b>SCIs Above T11:</b> Total loss of psychogenic arousal, preserved reflexogenic.</li>
        <li><b>SCIs S2-S4:</b> Loss of reflexogenic arousal, but psychogenic arousal is present.</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>IV. Stroke</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stroke is "acute focal neurological deficit from a vascular disorder." It can be ischaemic (85%) or haemorrhagic (15%).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A. Ischaemic Stroke</h3>
    <ul>

                <li>Initial flaccidity and decreased reflexes, then UMN signs develop (hypertonia, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski).</li>
                <li>Headache, seizures, vomiting, depressed consciousness possible.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Haemorrhagic Stroke</h3>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>D. Diagnosis (Stroke)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Clinical:</b> Based on features and neurological exam.</li>
        <li><b>Imaging:</b> Crucial to differentiate ischaemic from haemorrhagic stroke.
            <ul>
                <li><b>CT:</b> Sensitive for haemorrhagic stroke, less so for ischaemic stroke (especially in first few hours).</li>
                <li><b>MRI:</b> More sensitive for ischaemic stroke, especially small infarcts.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>A. Types</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Primary (Idiopathic) Parkinsonism:</b> Parkinson's Disease (PD) – most common type (80% of cases).</li>
        <li><b>Secondary Parkinson's Syndrome:</b> Due to structural brain damage (stroke, tumor), medications (dopamine receptor blockers), or other neurodegenerative disorders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Parkinson's Disease (PD)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pathology:</b> "Progressive degenerative disease of the basal nuclei in the CNS." "Marked degeneration of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal tract leading to impaired function of basal nuclei in motor control."</li>
        <li><b>Hallmark:</b> Presence of abnormal cytoplasmic deposits called Lewy bodies (in cell body) and Lewy neurites (in axons), composed of α-synuclein protein.</li>
        <li><b>Epidemiology:</b> Typically older individuals (>60 years), slightly more common in men. Majority of cases are sporadic (not genetic), but 10% have a genetic cause.</li>
        <li><b>Pathophysiology of Symptoms:</b> Increased inhibition in the motor thalamus, leading to decreased excitatory output to motor cortex, manifesting as bradykinesia/hypokinesia. Rigidity and tremor pathophysiology less clear.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Clinical Manifestations of Parkinsonism</h3>
    <ul>

        <li><b>Muscle Rigidity:</b> "Increased muscle tone to palpation at rest and increased resistance to passive movement." Can be "cogwheel" rigidity.</li>
        <li><b>Bradykinesia/Hypokinesia:</b> Slowness of voluntary movement. "Difficulty initiating movements, diminished amplitude of movements, and slowness in completing movements."</li>
        <li><b>Postural Instability:</b> Stooped posture, impaired balance, increased fall risk.</li>
