                    <h3>The Heart and Cardiac Cycle</h3>
                    <p>The heart is a four-chambered pump responsible for circulating blood. The <strong>cardiac cycle</strong> describes the sequence of events during one heartbeat, divided into two phases:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                        <li><strong>Systole:</strong> The period of ventricular contraction and blood ejection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diastole:</strong> The period of ventricular relaxation and filling.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Heart valves</strong> (tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, aortic) are crucial for ensuring unidirectional blood flow by opening and closing in response to pressure changes between the chambers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="physiology-box">
                    <h3>Cardiac Output and Blood Pressure</h3>
                    <p><strong>Cardiac Output (CO)</strong> is the volume of blood pumped by each ventricle per minute. It is the primary determinant of oxygen delivery to the tissues.</p>
                    <p class="text-center font-mono my-2">CO = Heart Rate (HR) × Stroke Volume (SV)</p>
                    <p><strong>Stroke Volume (SV)</strong> is the volume of blood ejected per beat, influenced by:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                        <li><strong>Preload:</strong> The stretch on the ventricular muscle at the end of diastole (determined by venous return).</li>
                        <li><strong>Afterload:</strong> The resistance the ventricle must overcome to eject blood.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contractility:</strong> The intrinsic strength of the cardiac muscle.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Blood Pressure (BP)</strong> is the force exerted by blood against the vessel walls.</p>
                     <p class="text-center font-mono my-2">BP = Cardiac Output (CO) × Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="physiology-box">
                    <h3>Blood Vessels, Clotting, and Capillary Exchange</h3>
                    <p><strong>Arteries</strong> are thick, muscular, elastic vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart under high pressure. <strong>Veins</strong> are thin-walled, compliant vessels with valves that return deoxygenated blood to the heart under low pressure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Blood Clotting (Hemostasis)</strong> is the process that stops bleeding. It involves platelet aggregation to form a plug and the activation of the coagulation cascade to form a stable fibrin clot.</p>
                    <p><strong>Capillary Exchange</strong> is the movement of fluid, nutrients, and waste between the blood and interstitial fluid. It is governed by the balance between <strong>hydrostatic pressure</strong> (pushes fluid out of capillaries) and <strong>colloid osmotic pressure</strong> (pulls fluid into capillaries).</p>

                    <h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
                    <p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of medium to large arteries, characterized by the formation of lipid-rich plaques (atheromas) in the vessel wall. The "response to injury" hypothesis is the most accepted model:</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Endothelial Injury:</strong> Chronic injury to the inner lining of the artery, caused by risk factors like hypertension, smoking, and hyperlipidemia.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lipid Accumulation & Inflammation:</strong> The damaged endothelium becomes permeable, allowing LDL ("bad") cholesterol to enter the vessel wall. This LDL becomes oxidized, triggering an inflammatory response. Monocytes are recruited, enter the wall, and transform into macrophages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Foam Cell Formation:</strong> Macrophages engulf the oxidized LDL, becoming lipid-laden "foam cells." Aggregates of foam cells form the earliest visible lesion, the <strong>fatty streak</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plaque Progression:</strong> Smooth muscle cells migrate into the lesion and proliferate, depositing collagen and forming a fibrous cap over the lipid core. This creates a mature <strong>fibrofatty atheroma</strong> that narrows the arterial lumen.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Complications</strong> arise when plaques become unstable and rupture, exposing the thrombogenic lipid core and leading to acute thrombosis.</p>

It is the final common pathway for many cardiovascular diseases.
