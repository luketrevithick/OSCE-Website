    <h1>Musculoskeletal System Overview</h1>

    ---

    <h2>1. Arthritis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Arthritis is defined as "an acute or chronic joint inflammation that often co-exists with pain and structural joint damage." It is distinct from arthralgia, which is simply joint pain without active inflammation. There are over 100 types of arthritis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.1 Osteoarthritis (OA)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> The most common form of arthritis, sometimes "wrongly called non-inflammatory arthritis." The term 'osteoarthritis' is considered a "misnomer" as inflammation is generally "minor and secondary to joint injury." 'Osteoarthrosis' is suggested as a better term.</li>
        <li><b>Pathology:</b> Characterized by "degeneration of articular cartilage and simultaneous proliferation of new bone."</li>
        <li><b>Prevalence:</b> Affects "about 3.5% of the population globally" and increases with age; "80% of the population over 65 years old has radiographic evidence of OA."</li>
        <li><b>Treatment:</b> Pharmacological treatment includes "Paracetamol" and "NSAIDs" (oral or topical). Oral NSAIDs should be used "very cautiously with close monitoring long term" due to side effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Inflammatory Arthritis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inflammatory arthritis can stem from:
            <ul>
                <li>Autoimmune processes (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis).</li>
                <li>Crystal deposition (e.g., sodium urate in gout, calcium pyrophosphate in pseudogout).</li>
                <li>Infections (e.g., septic arthritis).</li>
                <li>Other autoimmune connective tissue diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "An autoimmune, symmetrical, destructive and deforming polyarthritis affecting small and large synovial joints, with associated systemic disturbances."</li>
        <li><b>Etiology:</b> Genetic factors contribute significantly (50-60% for seropositive RA, 20% for seronegative RA), with HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 tissue types increasing risk. "Cigarette smoking is the strongest environmental risk factor."</li>
        <li><b>Pathology:</b> Main articular feature is "chronic inflammation in the synovial membrane (synovitis) characterised by angiogenesis... hyperplasia of synovial cells, and accumulation of lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophil leukocytes." A "Thickened and swollen synovial membrane called pannus spreads over the articular cartilage, which is progressively eroded and destroyed."</li>
        <li><b>Clinical Features:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Joints:</b> Symmetrical polyarthritis, affecting metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, wrists, knees, ankles, feet, shoulders, elbows, and cervical spine. Common deformities include "ulnar deviation... ‘button-hole’... and ‘swan neck’ deformity." A "popliteal (Baker’s) cyst may develop."</li>
                <li><b>Systemic:</b> Can affect various organs, leading to "anaemia... eye inflammation... mouth dryness, pericarditis, myocarditis, cardiac arrhythmias, pleurisy with pleural effusions, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis... and peripheral neuropathy." Subcutaneous "Rheumatoid nodules" are common.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Diagnosis:</b> Imaging (X-ray, MRI) reveals "periarticular osteopoenia, joint space narrowing... and bony erosions" in advanced stages.</li>
        <li><b>Treatment:</b> Involves pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches.
            <ul>
                <li><b>NSAIDs:</b> Reduce pain and swelling but are "not disease-modifying."</li>
                <li><b>Corticosteroids:</b> Provide "fast and significant anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects" but have "numerous and serious side effects."</li>
                <li><b>DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs):</b> "Target the immune and inflammatory processes" to "inhibit development and progression of structural joint damage." Include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g., methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine).</li>
                        <li>Synthetic targeted DMARDs (JAK inhibitors like tofacitinib).</li>
                        <li>Biologic DMARDs (e.g., anti-TNF-α drugs like etanercept, non-TNF-α biologics like tocilizumab).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "Heterogeneous group of idiopathic inflammatory arthritis" formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Affects children "under 16 years of age."</li>
        <li><b>Prevalence:</b> "Affects at least one child in every 1,000 in Australia."</li>
        <li><b>Classification:</b> Seven clinical forms, including oligoarthritis (~50% of cases, 4 or less joints, typically large) and polyarthritis (~25% of cases, 5 or more joints bilaterally).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.5 Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A group of conditions where inflammation occurs at the "entheses" (sites where ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules attach to bone), rather than primarily in the synovium. Associated with sacroiliitis (inflammation of sacroiliac joints) and often dactylitis ("sausage digit"). Includes:</li>
        <li><b>Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS):</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Definition:</b> "Chronic inflammatory arthritis that affects mainly the sacroiliac joints and spine, leading to progressive stiffening and fusion of the axial skeleton."</li>
                <li><b>Diagnosis:</b> Clinical criteria include "low back pain of at least 3 months duration, alleviated by exercise, not relieved by rest," "restricted lumbar spinal motion (positive Schober’s test)," and "decreased chest expansion."</li>
                <li><b>Progression:</b> Can lead to "spinal fusion... in form of a ‘bamboo spine’."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Reactive Arthritis (ReA):</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Definition:</b> "Inflammatory arthritis that develops following some enteric infection... or sexually acquired infection."</li>
                <li><b>Pathogenesis:</b> Considered an "autoimmune process that develops in susceptible individuals in response to infection in another part of the body." "Associated with HLA-B27 in ~50% of cases."</li>
                <li><b>Clinical Features:</b> Often presents with the classic triad of arthritis, urethritis/cervicitis, and conjunctivitis. Mucosal lesions and "keratoderma blennorrhagicum" (skin rash) may occur.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA):</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Definition:</b> "Chronic inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis (PsO) and found in about 20 to 30% of such patients."</li>
                <li><b>Pathology:</b> "Enthesitis... is the prominent pathologic feature" in contrast to synovitis in RA. "Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are frequently involved."</li>
                <li><b>Clinical Presentation:</b> Varied, with five types recognized, including oligoarticular, polyarticular, distal arthritis, arthritis mutilans, and spondyloarthritis pattern.</li>
                <li><b>Nail Involvement:</b> Common, present in "80 to 90% of patients," characterized by subungual keratosis, onycholysis, and pitting.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>2. Osteoporosis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "A decrease in the amount of bone tissue (both bone matrix and mineral content) and micro-architectural deterioration that can lead to fractures following minimal trauma." Occurs when "rate of bone resorption exceeds rate of bone formation."</li>
        <li><b>Prevalence:</b> "More common in females than in males" (23% in adult women vs. 11% in men). "More than 50% of postmenopausal white women will have an osteoporotic-related fracture."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classification:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Primary Osteoporosis (80% of cases):</b> Related to aging and decreasing sex hormones. Risk factors include insufficient calcium/vitamin D, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, alcohol, high caffeine/salt intake.</li>
        <li><b>Secondary Osteoporosis:</b> Caused by other conditions or medications (e.g., glucocorticoid overproduction/therapy, hyperthyroidism, chronic organ failure, malabsorption, inflammatory conditions like RA and AS). Men are "much more likely than women to have secondary osteoporosis."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>DXA Scan (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry):</b> Gold standard, typically measures spine and hips.
            <ul>
                <li><b>T-score:</b> Used for postmenopausal women and men >50 years.
                    <ul>
                        <li>-1 and above = normal</li>
                        <li>-1 to -2.5 = osteopenia</li>
                        <li>-2.5 and below = osteoporosis</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Z-score:</b> Used for patients <50 years or when secondary osteoporosis is suspected. A score < -1.5 warrants workup for secondary causes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS):</b> Screening method, cheaper and radiation-free.</li>
        <li><b>Bone Turnover Markers (BTMs):</b> Used to monitor treatment efficacy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Treatment:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Lifestyle changes:</b> "regular weight-bearing physical exercise," avoid smoking/alcohol.</li>
        <li><b>Supplements:</b> "calcium (at least 1g per day) and vitamin D daily (at least 600 IU)."</li>
        <li><b>Medications:</b> "biphosphonates" (first-line, inhibit osteoclasts), "raloxifene" (SERM), "denosumab" (monoclonal antibody), "teriparatide" (PTH analog for severe cases).</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>3. Osteomalacia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "Metabolic bone disease of adults characterised by impaired mineralisation of bone matrix as a result of decreased deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite." Rickets is the pediatric equivalent.</li>
        <li><b>Cause:</b> "Usually due to prolonged deficiency of vitamin D."</li>
        <li><b>Pathology:</b> Vitamin D is crucial for intestinal calcium absorption. Deficiency can be due to reduced skin synthesis, inadequate dietary intake, or diminished intestinal absorption.</li>
        <li><b>Clinical Features:</b> Generalized bone pain, muscle weakness, gait abnormalities, tenderness, and sometimes fractures.</li>
        <li><b>Diagnosis:</b> X-rays show "reduced bone density" and "pseudofractures (Looser’s zones)." Blood tests show low 25-hydroxy-vitamin D.</li>
        <li><b>Treatment:</b> Vitamin D and calcium supplementation.</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>4. Gout</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "Group of related diseases... characterised by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals deposition in joints, tendons/tendon sheaths and other tissues."</li>
        <li><b>Cause:</b> Develops from "elevated uric acid in blood (hyperuricaemia)." Hyperuricemia can be due to "decreased renal excretion of uric acid" (most common, 90%) or "increased production of uric acid."</li>
        <li><b>Risk Factors:</b> Heredity, alcohol abuse (especially beer), diuretics, chronic renal insufficiency, purine-rich foods (liver, anchovies), increased cell turnover (e.g., blood malignancies, severe psoriasis).</li>
        <li><b>Prevalence:</b> "Up to 4% of adult population," more common in men (3-6%) than women (1-2%). Typically occurs in the 30-60 age group.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stages:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Asymptomatic hyperuricemia.</li>
        <li>Acute gouty arthritis (flares).</li>
        <li>Interval/intercritical gout (asymptomatic periods between flares).</li>
        <li>Advanced stage: chronic tophaceous gout/chronic gouty arthritis (constant inflammation, "tophi" – intra-articular and subcutaneous MSU deposits).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Complications:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"About 20% of patients with gout develop urolithiasis (uric acid kidney stones)." Urate nephropathy can also occur.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Highly suggested by clinical presentation. "Synovial fluid can be aspirated and examined under special microscope with polarised light when needle-shaped crystals of monosodium urate could be seen. This appearance is unique to gout." Imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, DECT) can show MSU deposition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Treatment:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Acute Flares:</b> "NSAIDs except aspirin," "Colchicine," or "oral glucocorticoids."</li>
        <li><b>Prevention:</b> Lowering blood uric acid level (target <0.35 mmol/L) with drugs like "Allopurinol and febuxostat" (reduce uric acid formation) or "probenecid" (increases uric acid excretion).</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>5. Calcium Pyrophosphate (CPP) Crystal Arthritis (Pseudogout)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> Similar to gout but caused by "calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clinical Presentation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Acute CPP crystal arthritis:</b> Resembles acute gout, often affecting a single large joint (e.g., knee, wrist).</li>
        <li><b>Chronic CPP deposition arthritis ('pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis'):</b> Can resemble RA, with stiffness, pain, and swelling in multiple joints.</li>
        <li><b>Chondrocalcinosis:</b> Characteristic radiological finding of "articular cartilage calcification," often asymptomatic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Presence of CPP crystals on polarized microscopy of synovial fluid.</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>6. Paget's Disease of Bone (PDB)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "A chronic metabolic bone disorder characterised by excessive and disorganised bone remodelling, resulting in structurally unstable and enlarged bone with reduced mechanical strength."</li>
        <li><b>Pathology:</b> Involves "increased osteoclastic bone resorption followed by compensatory increase in bone formation by osteoblasts," leading to a "mosaic-like ('jigsaw' puzzle) pattern" in affected bone.</li>
        <li><b>Location:</b> Most commonly affects the "pelvis (58-80%), spine and skull (40%), femur (32%) and tibia (16-20%)."</li>
        <li><b>Clinical Features:</b> 70-90% are asymptomatic. Symptoms include "bone pain," "headaches, hearing impairment and vertigo" if the skull is involved. Bone deformities and "Pathologic fractures" may occur.</li>
        <li><b>Diagnosis:</b> Elevated total ALP (or bone-specific ALP), abnormal bone turnover markers. "Plain radiography and CT are recommended" as characteristic bone changes are recognizable.</li>

    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>7. Back Pain</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Prevalence:</b> "Affects men and women equally, with onset most often between the ages of 30 and 50 years." "90% of patients have pain due to a ‘mechanical’ problem."</li>
        <li><b>Causes (Non-Mechanical):</b> Spinal infections, tumors, inflammatory arthritis (e.g., AS, ReA), Paget's disease.</li>
        <li><b>Inflammatory Low Back Pain:</b> Suggestive features include "onset in a person younger than 40 years," "insidious rather than abrupt onset," and "persistence of back symptoms for 3 months or longer."</li>
        <li><b>Radiculopathy:</b> Caused by "protruding or ruptured intervertebral disc with subsequent herniation of the nucleus pulposus into the spinal canal." Causes "sensory and motor abnormalities, typically on one lower extremity," such as "sciatica."</li>
        <li><b>Cauda Equina Syndrome:</b> A "medical emergency" caused by "compression of the cauda equina nerve roots." Presents with "motor weakness or paralysis in both lower extremities," "bladder and/or bowel incontinence," and "loss of genital/perianal sensation."</li>
    </ul>

        <li><b>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD):</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Inheritance:</b> "X-linked recessive trait," affecting almost exclusively boys (1 in 3,500 live male births).</li>
                <li><b>Cause:</b> Mutations in the "dystrophin gene," leading to "little or no dystrophin." Dystrophin links sarcomere thin filaments to the cell membrane, maintaining structural integrity and transferring contraction force. Its absence reduces muscle strength and increases membrane deformability.</li>
                <li><b>Clinical Course:</b> Most common and severe. "Weakness becomes apparent by age of 3-5," starting in "pelvic girdle muscles" and progressing to "shoulder girdle and trunk." "Gowers’ sign" is characteristic. Patients "lose ability to walk by 10-12 years."</li>
                <li><b>Complications:</b> Frequent respiratory infections, "Cardiomyopathy is a common feature." Patients generally die by age 20-25 from cardiac or respiratory complications.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD):</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Inheritance:</b> "X-linked recessive trait."</li>
                <li><b>Cause:</b> Mutations in the dystrophin gene, but with "reduced amounts of dystrophin," leading to a milder form.</li>
                <li><b>Clinical Course:</b> Manifests later (childhood/adolescence) with slower progression. Ambulation usually preserved beyond age 15.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>High blood levels of "creatine kinase (CK-MM)," EMG showing muscle destruction, and "genetic testing."</li>
    </ul>
