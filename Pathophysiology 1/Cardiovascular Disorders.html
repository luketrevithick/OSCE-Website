    <h1>Cardiovascular System Overview</h1>

    ---

    <h2>I. Atherosclerosis and Arteriosclerosis</h2>
    <h3>Distinction between terms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>While often used interchangeably, <b>arteriosclerosis</b> is a broader term referring to a group of processes characterized by "thickening, hardening and loss of elasticity of arterial blood vessels."</li>
        <li><b>Atherosclerosis</b> is "the most important form of arteriosclerosis."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Atherosclerosis Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A "chronic arterial disease affecting medium-large arteries and characterised by... accumulation of lipids and collagen within the walls of arteries."</li>
        <li>Its defining feature is the development of <b>atheromas</b> or <b>atheromatous plaques</b>, which "grow towards the arterial lumen leading to its narrowing."</li>
        <li>The term 'athero' means "gruel or porridge," referring to the lipid-rich core of the plaque.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hyaline Arteriolosclerosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A specific type of arteriosclerosis involving "thickening of the arteriolar wall due to the accumulation of homogeneous material that stains pink."</li>
        <li>Associated with "normal aging process, but also hypertension and diabetes mellitus," commonly found in the kidneys.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Progressive Nature:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Atherosclerosis is "an inevitable part of the ageing process" and "appears to start in young age."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risk Factors:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Genetics:</b> "appears to run in families," likely due to "genetic defects in lipid metabolism" and "abnormalities in various aspects of chronic inflammation."</li>
        <li><b>Sex:</b> Males are more prone before menopause; incidence increases in women after menopause due to hormonal changes (estrogens "reduce LDL level and increase HDL level").</li>
        <li><b>Hyperlipidaemia (Dyslipidaemia):</b> Elevated lipid levels, classified as primary (inherited) or secondary (acquired). Types include hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, or combined.</li>
        <li><b>"Bad Cholesterol" (LDL):</b> "low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)... supply cholesterol to peripheral tissues." Levels depend on "genetics, diet and exercise (both cholesterol-rich and saturated-fat rich diets raise LDL)."</li>
        <li><b>"Good Cholesterol" (HDL):</b> "High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) remove cholesterol from peripheral tissues and return it to the liver."</li>
        <li><b>Common Causes:</b> "diet rich in cholesterol, saturated fats and trans fats," diabetes, excessive alcohol intake, obesity, reduced physical activity, hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, chronic liver diseases, and certain medications.</li>
        <li><b>Triglycerides:</b> Constitute a "separate and independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, but not as important as cholesterol."</li>
        <li><b>Hypertension:</b> Increases risk through "increased shear stress imposed on the endothelium by elevated blood pressure."</li>
        <li><b>Smoking:</b> Increases risk through "oxidation of LDL, reduction of HDL level, direct damage of the endothelium and platelet activation."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pathogenesis Theories:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Encrustation Hypothesis:</b> Plaques formed by "repeated thrombosis."</li>
        <li><b>Insudation Hypothesis:</b> Process develops by "increased permeability to lipids from plasma."</li>
        <li><b>Response to Injury Hypothesis (Ross and Glomset, 1972):</b> Plaques form "in response to endothelial injury." Key steps include endothelial cell changes, increased permeability to lipids (especially oxidized LDL) and leukocytes, and smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Plaque Characteristics & Complications:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Calcification:</b> "deposition of calcium," known as "dystrophic calcification." Generally has a "stabilising effect on the plaque, reducing the probability of its rupture."</li>
        <li><b>Haemorrhage:</b> "Newly formed blood vessels around the plaque have relatively fragile walls and may rupture, leading to haemorrhage into the plaque, sudden plaque expansion."</li>
        <li><b>Ischaemia:</b> Larger plaques "sufficiently narrow down the lumen and reduce blood flow, which is known as ischaemia."</li>
        <li><b>Clinical Impact:</b> Varies depending on "arteries involved, plaque size and degree of narrowing."</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>II. Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD) / Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"a group of conditions characterised by impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries of the heart."</li>
        <li><b>Atherosclerosis</b> is "by far the most common cause."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Angina Pectoris:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chest pain due to myocardial ischaemia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Severity Grading (Canadian Cardiovascular Society - CCS):</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Class I: Angina only during strenuous activity.</li>
        <li>Class II: Angina during vigorous activity.</li>
        <li>Class III: Angina with everyday activities.</li>
        <li>Class IV: Inability to perform any activity without angina, or angina at rest.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Used for angina relief. Its main action is "dilation of peripheral veins," reducing "venous return," and thus "cardiac work."</li>
        <li>GTN "cannot produce substantial dilation of blood vessels narrowed by atherosclerosis."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal’s/Variant Angina):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"occurs during rest (often awaking the patient from sleep) and responds well to GTN."</li>
        <li>Caused by "vasospasm (vasoconstriction) of coronary arteries," often in the presence of atherosclerotic plaques.</li>
        <li>More common in younger individuals with fewer atherosclerosis risk factors. Triggers include cocaine, amphetamines, and vasoconstrictor drugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spectrum of conditions from unstable angina to myocardial infarction, caused by "unstable atherosclerotic plaques tend to fissure or rupture, causing platelet aggregation and thrombus formation."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unstable Angina (UA):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"new onset with no previous history, especially if severe," "occurs at rest or with minimal exertion," or "occurs with a crescendo pattern."</li>
        <li>Considered a "preinfarction syndrome."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Myocardial Infarction (MI):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heart attack. Can be ST-segment elevation (STEMI) or non–ST-segment elevation (NSTEMI).</li>
        <li>Often presents with chest pain, but "Myocardial ischaemia does not always present with characteristic chest pain/discomfort but instead can be asymptomatic (silent ischaemia)."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Silent Ischaemia:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No symptoms, detected by ECG or cardiac perfusion imaging.</li>
        <li>Can progress to silent or symptomatic MI or heart failure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis (MI):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ECG changes, elevated cardiac enzymes (troponins, CK-MB).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Treatment (MI):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Immediate reperfusion (PCI or thrombolysis) for STEMI.</li>
        <li>NSTEMI management depends on stability, but PCI for refractory ischaemia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mortality:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"still carries a mortality rate of 5-30%, and the majority of deaths occur prior to arrival to the hospital."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnostic Procedures for Angina/Ischaemia:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Resting Electrocardiogram (ECG):</b> Often normal between episodes. Holter monitor for monitoring.</li>
        <li><b>Exercise Stress Test:</b> Useful if resting ECG is normal, to provoke ischaemia.</li>
        <li><b>Echocardiography:</b> Assess ventricular function, wall motion abnormalities.</li>
        <li><b>Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy (MPS/MIBI):</b> Detects areas of reduced blood flow.</li>
        <li><b>Coronary CT Angiography (CTA):</b> Visualizes coronary arteries.</li>
        <li><b>Coronary Angiography:</b> "still a gold-standard for confirmation of significant narrowing." Minimally invasive, involves catheter insertion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pharmacological Management:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Beta-blockers:</b> Reduce heart rate and contractility, decreasing oxygen demand.</li>
        <li><b>Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs):</b> Dilate coronary arteries, reduce contractility. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem) used. Avoid in patients with LV dysfunction.</li>
        <li><b>Nitrates:</b> Relax vascular smooth muscle, primarily dilating veins, reducing preload. Useful for vasospastic angina. Administered as sublingual GTN (acute), oral isosorbide dinitrate/mononitrate (long-acting), or transdermal GTN patch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reperfusion Therapy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) for refractory symptoms.</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>III. Valvular Disorders</h2>
    <h3>Function of Valves:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"promote unidirectional flow of blood."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Causes of Dysfunction:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Congenital or acquired (age-related calcification, infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Most Commonly Affected Valves:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mitral and aortic valves (left side of the heart).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Dysfunction:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Stenosis:</b> "valve leaflets are fused and fail to fully open," increasing "resistance to blood flow," leading to "increased workload of the chamber emptying through the narrowed valve" and hypertrophy.</li>
        <li><b>Incompetence (Regurgitation):</b> "valve leaflets fail to shut completely thus permitting backward flow." Causes volume overload and ventricular hypertrophy/dilation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clinical Manifestations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Abnormal heart sounds (murmurs).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Specific Valve Disorders:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mitral Valve Prolapse:</b> "common cause of mild mitral incompetence" (up to 2% of population). Leaflets become "enlarged and floppy and are pushed back into the LA during systole."</li>
        <li><b>Mitral Stenosis:</b> Reduces mitral orifice size (normal ~5 cm², severe <1 cm²). Leads to "increased workload of left atrium with increased LA pressure and LA hypertrophy and dilation." Can cause atrial fibrillation (AF) and "pulmonary oedema." If gradual, can lead to pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. Associated with a "low-pitched middiastolic murmur."</li>
        <li><b>Aortic Stenosis:</b> Narrowing of aortic valve, increasing resistance to LV ejection.</li>
        <li><b>Aortic Incompetence:</b> "backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole." Causes "abnormal drop in diastolic pressure" and increased pulse pressure. Accompanied by an "early diastolic regurgitant murmur."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Investigations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Chest X-ray:</b> Shows heart size, pulmonary congestion/oedema.</li>
        <li><b>Electrocardiogram (ECG):</b> Shows chamber hypertrophy, arrhythmias.</li>
        <li><b>Echocardiography (Transthoracic & Transoesophageal - TOE):</b> Gold standard. Visualizes valves, chambers, measures blood flow (Doppler mode), wall thickness, and ejection fraction. TOE is "more sensitive in detecting vegetations."</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>IV. Infective Endocarditis (IE)</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"microbial infection of the heart valves or mural endocardium (lining of heart chambers)."</li>
        <li>Characterized by "sterile thrombosis on one or more heart valves."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risk Factors:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Acquired/congenital valvular abnormalities.</li>
        <li>Prosthetic heart valves.</li>
        <li>Intravenous drug abuse (nonsterile instruments).</li>
        <li>Alcohol abuse.</li>
        <li>Long-term indwelling IV catheters.</li>
        <li>Recent cardiac surgery/invasive heart interventions.</li>
        <li>Cancer chemotherapy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pathophysiology:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bacteria attach to cardiac valves, eroding surface. Damaged endocardium and bacteria activate platelets and clotting, forming "thrombi made of fibrin and platelets," which enlarge into "cauliflower-like structures" called vegetations containing bacteria.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clinical Consequences:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Systemic Embolism:</b> Fragile vegetations can detach, forming emboli causing:
            <ul>
                <li>Small bleedings: petechiae (skin, hands, feet, under nails - 'splinter haemorrhages'), conjunctivae.</li>
                <li>Renal infarctions (macroscopic haematuria).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Heart Murmurs:</b> Usually regurgitant type.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Echocardiography (TOE more sensitive for vegetations and valve damage).</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>V. Cardiomyopathies</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"a diverse group of heart muscle diseases that cause deterioration of the myocardial function."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Causes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Primary:</b> Idiopathic, often genetic (defects in cardiac myocytes, contractile proteins, cytoskeleton).</li>
        <li><b>Secondary:</b> Chronic myocardial ischaemia, post-MI, long-standing hypertension, myocarditis, toxicity (alcohol, heavy metals, chemotherapy), systemic autoimmune diseases, endocrine diseases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classifications:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM):</b> "inappropriate left ventricular hypertrophy." Often genetic.</li>
        <li><b>Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM):</b> Ventricular dilation and impaired systolic function.</li>
        <li><b>Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM):</b> Stiff ventricular walls, impaired diastolic filling despite normal systolic function.</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>VI. Heart Failure (HF)</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"a clinical syndrome characterized by a reduced ability of the heart to pump blood around the body (or fill with blood)."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Systolic Heart Failure (HFrEF):</b> Reduced ejection fraction (EF < 50%), typically due to reduced myocardial contractility or "ventricular outflow obstruction" (e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis).</li>
        <li><b>Diastolic Heart Failure (HFpEF):</b> Preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥ 50%), due to "reduced ventricular filling during diastole" (e.g., mitral/tricuspid stenosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, tamponade, pericardial effusion).</li>
        <li><b>Left-Sided Heart Failure:</b> Reduced left ventricular output. Causes "increased pressure in pulmonary arterial vessels (pulmonary hypertension) and right ventricular strain." Can lead to pulmonary oedema. Causes include IHD, chronic hypertension, aortic/mitral valve abnormalities, myocarditis, cardiomyopathies.</li>
        <li><b>Right-Sided Heart Failure:</b> Reduced right ventricular output. Leads to "congestion in the peripheral veins" (legs, abdomen). Most common cause is left-sided heart failure. Can also occur due to lung conditions ("cor pulmonale" in COPD) leading to pulmonary hypertension.</li>
        <li><b>Biventricular Failure:</b> Both sides affected, either due to a common disease process or left-sided failure leading to right-sided failure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dyspnoea (especially on exertion or nocturnal), orthopnoea, fatigue, peripheral oedema (pitting oedema).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Investigations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Chest X-ray:</b> Cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion/oedema (left-sided).</li>
        <li><b>ECG:</b> Arrhythmias, IHD, hypertrophy (not specific).</li>
        <li><b>Echocardiography:</b> Measures SV, EDV, EF, wall thickness, chamber size, and identifies wall motion abnormalities.</li>
        <li><b>MRI:</b> Gold standard for chamber size and ejection fraction due to high accuracy.</li>
        <li><b>Radionuclide Ventriculography (MUGA scan):</b> Visualizes heart's filling/pumping, assesses systolic/diastolic function, wall motion, valvular dysfunction, EF.</li>
        <li><b>Natriuretic Peptides (NPs):</b> ANP (atrial) and BNP/NT-proBNP (ventricular) released in response to atrial/ventricular distension. BNP/NT-proBNP are useful for diagnosis and severity assessment, especially for excluding HF.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Management:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Complex, often involves ACEIs/ARBs, ARNI (sacubitril/valsartan for HFrEF), beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, SGLT2 inhibitors. No drug has shown benefit in HFpEF.</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>VII. Diseases of Veins</h2>
    <h3>Veins:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Low-pressure, thin-walled vessels with valves, relying on skeletal muscle pump and intrathoracic pressure. Susceptible to stasis, distension, and insufficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Varicose Veins:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"distended, enlarged and tortuous" veins, usually in superficial leg veins.</li>
        <li><b>Primary:</b> Due to "incompetence of the venous valves."</li>
        <li><b>Secondary:</b> Result from "deep vein thrombosis, congenital arteriovenous fistulas, or compression of veins by tumours or pregnancy."</li>
        <li><b>Complications:</b> Pain, itching, fatigue, oedema, stasis dermatitis, venous ulcers (chronic skin defects, "relatively painless and often infected"), superficial thrombophlebitis.</li>
        <li><b>Treatment:</b> Support stockings, sclerotherapy, surgical removal ('vein stripping'), endovenous ablation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a deep vein, mainly of the lower extremities."</li>
        <li>Proximal DVTs (popliteal, femoral, iliac) are more common and carry higher risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Virchow's Triad (Factors associated with venous thrombosis):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Hypercoagulability:</b> Increased tendency of blood to clot (oral contraceptives, dehydration, old age, smoking, obesity, polycythaemia vera, thrombocytosis, genetic abnormalities, antiphospholipid syndrome).</li>
        <li><b>Endothelial Damage:</b> Less important than in arterial thrombosis.</li>
        <li><b>Venous Stasis:</b> Slowing of blood flow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Symptoms (DVT):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Leg pain, tenderness, swelling, increased warmth, redness. Homan's sign has "low" sensitivity and specificity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outcomes (DVT):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lysis, recanalization, organization (scar tissue), embolism (most serious, leading to pulmonary embolism).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Investigations (DVT):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>D-dimer:</b> Elevated in thrombosis, highly sensitive for exclusion when negative.</li>
        <li><b>Duplex Ultrasonography:</b> Gold standard. Shows venous mass, non-compressibility of vein, narrowed/absent flow.</li>
        <li><b>X-ray Venography:</b> Accurate but uncomfortable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Treatment (DVT):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Anticoagulants (heparins, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants) for 3-6 months. Thrombolysis for extensive clots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Complications (DVT):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pulmonary Embolism (PE):</b> Obstruction of pulmonary circulation by embolus, usually from DVT. Proximal DVTs have >50% risk. Can cause "critical ischaemia and necrosis of a section of lung tissue (pulmonary infarction)." DVT and PE are termed venous thromboembolism (VTE).</li>
        <li><b>Post-thrombotic Syndrome (PTS):</b> Affects up to 50% after DVT, a "manifestation of chronic venous insufficiency" due to "valvular incompetence and venous hypertension," leading to "congestion, oedema, and eventual impairment of tissue nutrition." Symptoms similar to varicose veins but more severe.</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>VIII. Aneurysms</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"localized abnormal dilation of a blood vessel or the heart." Result from "weakening of the vessel wall."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common Causes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Atherosclerosis, hypertension, syphilis, trauma, genetic defects (Marfan syndrome), infections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Morphology:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Saccular (Berry):</b> "localised outpouching... affecting only one side," spherical, often thrombosed.</li>
        <li><b>Fusiform:</b> "circumferential spindle-shaped dilation."</li>
        <li><b>Dissecting:</b> Haemorrhage into vessel wall forming a blood-filled channel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Location:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are most common. Thoracic aortic aneurysms can be asymptomatic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Usually incidental on imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI).</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>IX. Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"chronic progressive atherosclerotic disease leading to partial or total peripheral vascular occlusion." Typically affects iliac, lower limb, and sometimes upper extremity arteries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risk Factors:</h3>
    <ul>

    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Over 50% are asymptomatic. Primary symptom is intermittent claudication ("pain with walking that makes the patient to start limping and forces them to take a rest").</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Acute Limb Ischaemia (ALI):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sudden, complete blockage of arterial blood flow due to thrombosis on plaque or embolism.</li>
        <li>Presents with "sudden onset of severe rest pain, limb pallor, paraesthesia (tingling) and absence of pulse." Medical emergency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI):</b> Cost-effective, non-invasive. Ratio of systolic ankle pressure to systolic brachial pressure. Normal ABI is 0.9-1.2; values <0.9 "highly suggestive of PAD."</li>
        <li><b>Duplex Ultrasonography:</b> Assesses stenosis, hemodynamic severity, plaque characteristics.</li>
        <li><b>MRA or CTA.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>X. Raynaud's Phenomenon</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"functional disorder caused by intense vasospasm of the arteries and arterioles in the fingers and, less often, the toes."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Primary (Raynaud's Disease):</b> More common, less severe, idiopathic, usually develops before age 30 in healthy women. "Hyper-reactivity of the sympathetic nervous system has been suggested."</li>
        <li><b>Secondary:</b> Associated with underlying conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases like scleroderma, lupus).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Triggers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cold temperatures or psychological stress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Symptoms (Raynaud's Attack):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Characteristic color changes: skin pallor (ischaemia) -> cyanosis (deoxygenated Hb) -> hyperaemia (vasodilation).</li>
        <li>Accompanied by cold sensation, numbness, tingling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>XI. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)</h2>
    <h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Requires "series of measurements" as BP can vary. Elevated readings at initial visit and two follow-up visits within 1 month. Daily measurements over several weeks are even better.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Primary (Essential) Hypertension:</b> "chronic elevation of blood pressure occurs without evidence of other conditions." Multifactorial, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Defects in renal sodium homeostasis (retention of sodium/water).</li>
                <li>Increased sympathetic nervous system activity.</li>
                <li>Defects in vascular smooth muscle function.</li>
                <li>Disruption of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).</li>
                <li>Insulin resistance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Secondary Hypertension:</b> Caused by another identifiable condition. Common causes include:
            <ul>
                <li>Kidney Disease: Reduced glomerular filtration, increased RAAS activity.</li>
                <li>Renal Artery Stenosis (Renovascular HTN): Usually due to atherosclerosis, causes reduced renal perfusion and RAAS activation.</li>
                <li>Endocrine disorders (aldosteronism, Cushing's, pheochromocytoma, thyroid disorders).</li>
                <li>Coarctation of the aorta.</li>
                <li>Drugs (oral contraceptives, corticosteroids).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Physiology of BP Regulation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>BP = Cardiac Output (CO) x Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR).</li>
        <li>CO = Heart Rate (HR) x Stroke Volume (SV).</li>
        <li>SVR affected by "blood vessel diameter (vascular tone)," "blood viscosity," and "total blood vessel length" (e.g., obesity increases vessel length).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Complications of Chronic Hypertension:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Heart:</b> Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), leading to diastolic dysfunction, heart failure, and increased risk of IHD.</li>
        <li><b>Blood Vessels:</b> Atherosclerosis, aortic dissection, aneurysms.</li>
        <li><b>Brain:</b> Cerebrovascular accidents (strokes - cerebral infarction/haemorrhage), vascular dementia.</li>
        <li><b>Retina:</b> Hypertensive retinopathy, progressive vision impairment.</li>
        <li><b>Kidneys:</b> Hypertensive nephropathy (nephrosclerosis), leading to arteriolosclerosis, glomerular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pharmacological Treatment:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Thiazide Diuretics:</b> Common, reduce blood volume, can cause hypokalaemia.</li>
        <li><b>Beta-adrenergic Receptor Blockers:</b> Reduce heart rate/contractility. Useful if HTN combined with IHD.</li>
        <li><b>ACE Inhibitors (ACEIs):</b> Prevent angiotensin II formation (e.g., enalapril, lisinopril).</li>
        <li><b>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs):</b> Block angiotensin II receptors (e.g., candesartan, valsartan).</li>
        <li><b>Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs):</b> Cause vasodilation (e.g., amlodipine, nifedipine). Can cause peripheral oedema.</li>
        <li><b>Alpha1-adrenergic Receptor Blockers:</b> Vasodilators (e.g., prazosin).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>XII. Oedema and Bleeding Disorders</h2>
    <h3>Oedema:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"accumulation of fluid in the interstitial tissue spaces."</li>
        <li><b>Generalised Oedema:</b> Affects most tissues, prominent in lower body due to gravity (legs, abdomen).</li>
        <li><b>Local Congestion:</b> Limited to specific region (legs in DVT, PTS, varicose veins; lungs in left ventricular failure).</li>
        <li><b>Pitting vs. Non-pitting Oedema:</b> Pitting is due to low protein fluid; non-pitting is due to viscous fluid with significant protein (e.g., angioedema, lymphatic obstruction). Myxoedema (hypothyroidism) is special, due to polysaccharide accumulation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Haematoma:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enclosed collection of blood in a tissue.</li>
        <li><b>Bruise:</b> Trauma-related subcutaneous haematoma.</li>
        <li><b>Petechiae:</b> <3 mm, platelet disorders.</li>
        <li><b>Purpura:</b> 3-10 mm, ruptured small vessels (vasculitis).</li>
        <li><b>Ecchymoses:</b> >1 cm, coagulation disorders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Blood Accumulation in Body Cavities:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Haemothorax</b> (pleural), <b>Haemopericardium</b> (pericardial), <b>Haemoperitoneum</b> (peritoneal), <b>Haemarthrosis</b> (joint).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>External Bleeding Terminology:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Haematuria:</b> Blood in urine (microscopic or macroscopic).</li>
        <li><b>Haematemesis:</b> Vomiting blood (red or 'coffee ground' due to gastric acid).</li>
        <li><b>Haematochezia:</b> Fresh blood in stools (lower GI).</li>
        <li><b>Melaena:</b> Dark, tarry stools (upper GI).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Thrombosis (Clotting):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Virchow's Triad for Thrombosis:</b> Endothelial injury, stasis/turbulence, hypercoagulability.</li>
        <li><b>Endothelial Injury:</b> Major factor for arterial thrombosis, often superimposed on atherosclerotic plaque.</li>
        <li><b>Stasis/Turbulence:</b> Important in venous thrombosis (e.g., varicose veins, DVT), and in cardiac chambers (e.g., atrial fibrillation, ventricular aneurysms, mitral stenosis).</li>
        <li><b>Hypercoagulability:</b> "alteration of the coagulation pathways that predisposes for thrombosis."</li>
        <li><b>Arterial Thrombi:</b> "firmly attached to the damaged arterial wall," "relatively pale (often greyish) and friable," composed of platelets, fibrin, leukocytes, few erythrocytes.</li>
        <li><b>Embolism:</b> Dislodged thrombus (embolus) travels to distant site, causing infarction. Systemic emboli (80%) arise from intracardiac thrombi or atherosclerotic plaques/aneurysms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>XIII. Shock</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"a syndrome that can occur in the course of many life-threatening traumatic conditions or disease states."</li>
        <li>Inadequate tissue perfusion leading to cellular hypoxia and damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types (based on mechanism):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Hypovolaemic Shock:</b> "acute loss of >-25% of blood volume," leading to inadequate vascular filling and reduced venous return. Most common cause is haemorrhage.</li>
        <li><b>Cardiogenic Shock:</b> Heart fails to pump adequate blood (e.g., MI, arrhythmias, valve failure).</li>
        <li><b>Neurogenic Shock:</b> Loss of sympathetic vascular tone (e.g., spinal cord injury).</li>
        <li><b>Anaphylactic Shock:</b> Severe allergic reaction causing widespread vasodilation.</li>
        <li><b>Septic Shock:</b> Severe systemic infection, often by Gram-negative bacteria due to release of endotoxins (Lipopolysaccharide - LPS). Causes myocardial suppression, peripheral vasodilation, capillary damage, microthrombi (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation - DIC), and haemorrhagic skin rash. Anaphylactic, neurogenic, and septic shock are often called distributive shock.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Progressive Nature:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial compensatory mechanisms (tachycardia, vasoconstriction) are followed by decompensation as cellular hypoxia worsens, leading to "deterioration of function of virtually all organs," known as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and eventually death.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clinical Presentation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"extreme weakness, confusion, impaired consciousness, hypotension, tachycardia with weak pulse, tachypnoea, cold/clammy/pale" skin (except in early septic/anaphylactic/neurogenic shock where skin may be warm and flushed).</li>
    </ul>
