    <h1>Respiratory System Overview</h1>

    ---

    <h2>I. Obstructive Lung Disorders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Obstructive lung disorders are characterized by "increased resistance to airflow because of conducting airways narrowing."</li>
        <li>This narrowing can result from processes within the airway lumen (e.g., increased secretions), in the airway wall (e.g., inflammation, muscle contraction), or due to loss of supporting structures (e.g., alveolar wall destruction).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Obstructive Conditions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Asthma:</b> A chronic inflammatory disease marked by "variable recurring symptoms of reversible airflow obstruction in form of episodic wheezing, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), chest tightness, and sometimes cough."</li>
        <li><b>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):</b> A group of disorders including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, characterized by "chronic, progressive and poorly reversible airflow obstruction."</li>
        <li><b>Bronchiectasis:</b> An "uncommon type of obstructive pulmonary disorder characterised by localised, irreversible dilation of the airways caused by deformations of the bronchial walls."</li>
        <li><b>Cystic Fibrosis (CF):</b> An inherited disease causing "abnormal transport of chloride (and indirectly sodium and water) across the epithelium, leading to thick, viscous secretions in various internal organs."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A. Spirometry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spirometry is a crucial pulmonary function test (PFT) used to assess ventilatory function and differentiate between obstructive and restrictive defects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Spirometric Measures:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC):</b> "the maximal volume of air that can be forcibly expelled from the lungs from a position of maximal inhalation."</li>
        <li><b>Vital Capacity (VC):</b> Similar to FVC but with slow exhalation.</li>
        <li><b>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1st second (FEV1):</b> "the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of an FVC manoeuvre."</li>
        <li><b>Forced Expiratory Ratio (FEV1/FVC or FER%):</b> "the percentage of FVC that can be exhaled in 1st second of forced expiration, it assists with distinguishing between obstruction and restriction when FEV1 is reduced."</li>
        <li><b>Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF):</b> "the maximum flow rate generated during a forceful exhalation."</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Obstructive Pattern on Spirometry:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Volume-time curve: "rises slowly leading to a drop of FEV1; the maximum volume reached (FVC) depends on degree of obstruction but it is lower than normal."</li>
        <li>"There is a disproportionate reduction in FEV1 as compared to FVC (decreased FEV1/FVC ratio)."</li>
        <li>Flow-volume loop: "shows concavity (kink) of the expiratory limb." The "maximum height of the expiratory limb (corresponding to ‘peak expiratory flow’) is reduced."</li>
        <li><b>Reversibility:</b> A key differentiator; airway obstruction in asthma is "largely reversible with bronchodilators," while in COPD, bronchodilators produce "little improvement." Clinically significant reversibility in asthma is defined as "12% or greater increase in the FEV1 in response to an inhaled bronchodilator."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Asthma</h3>
    <h4>Pathophysiology:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Three main factors contribute to airway narrowing:
            <ol>
                <li>Bronchospasm: Contraction of bronchial wall smooth muscle.</li>
                <li>Hypersecretion and reduced removal of mucus: Due to increased viscosity.</li>
                <li>Airway wall oedema: Swelling.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Clinical Presentation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Episodic (intermittent) pattern:</b> Sudden onset episodes of "auscultatory or audible wheezing especially evident during expiration, prolonged expiratory phase, chest tightness, shortness of breath (dyspnoea) and sometimes cough."</li>
        <li><b>Chronic (persistent) pattern:</b> "Certain degree of chest tightness/dyspnoea all/most of the time."</li>
        <li><b>Status Asthmaticus:</b> A "severe asthmatic episode" requiring emergency treatment, characterized by "very marked airway limitation, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, hypoxaemia and central cyanosis," often with absent wheezing due to severe airflow reduction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Diagnosis:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Primarily clinical, based on history, findings, PFTs, and bronchodilator response.</li>
        <li><b>Spirometry:</b> Shows "somewhat reduced FVC (due to air trapping), more markedly reduced FEV1 and peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate; FEV1/FVC ratio is also reduced."</li>
        <li><b>Skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE test:</b> Used to identify allergens, helping to distinguish between allergic (extrinsic) and non-allergic (intrinsic) asthma.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Treatment:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Asthma cannot be cured but can be controlled.</li>
        <li><b>Bronchodilators (relievers):</b> Reverse bronchospasm (e.g., short-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (SABA), long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA), short-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (SAMA), long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMA)).</li>
        <li><b>Anti-inflammatory drugs (preventers):</b> Control inflammation (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)).</li>
        <li><b>Allergen immunotherapy (AIT):</b> "Long-term (2-3 years) administration of increasing doses of the allergen(s)" for selected cases of allergic asthma.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>COPD encompasses chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Chronic Bronchitis:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Defined clinically as "a persistent productive cough for at least 3 consecutive months in at least 2 consecutive years."</li>
        <li>Pathologically involves hypertrophy of mucus-secreting glands, increased mucus production, and chronic inflammation leading to airway narrowing.</li>
        <li><b>"Blue Bloater":</b> A classic presentation with "cyanosis, obesity and fluid retention/oedema associated with right-sided heart failure" in advanced stages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Emphysema:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Defined pathologically as "abnormal permanent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by destruction of their walls without obvious fibrosis."</li>
        <li>Caused by "breakdown of elastin and other alveolar wall structural components by enzymes called proteases," often in response to cigarette smoke.</li>
        <li>Leads to "loss of surrounding supporting structure with expiratory airway collapse."</li>
        <li><b>"Pink Puffer":</b> Classic presentation with "lack of cyanosis, the use of accessory muscles, and pursed-lip (‘puffer’) breathing" to maintain airway pressure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Diagnosis (COPD):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Spirometry:</b> Shows reduced FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio that "do not significantly improve after administration of inhaled bronchodilators."</li>
        <li><b>Lung CT:</b> Very sensitive for emphysema (showing abnormal air spaces/bullae).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Bronchiectasis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> Irreversible dilation and deformation of bronchial walls, often filled with "mucopurulent secretions."</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Causes:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Not a primary disease, but a consequence of other conditions.</li>
        <li><b>Congenital:</b> Cystic fibrosis (most common), primary ciliary dyskinesia.</li>
        <li><b>Acquired:</b> Repetitive respiratory infections, AIDS, tuberculosis, and often occurs in up to 50% of patients with moderate-to-severe chronic bronchitis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Clinical Features:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Main feature: "productive cough with abundant thick, green/yellow, mucopurulent, foul-smelling sputum daily."</li>
        <li>Dyspnoea on exertion and wheezing in advanced stages.</li>
        <li>Recurrent bronchopneumonia is a common complication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Diagnosis (Bronchiectasis):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Spirometry (similar to COPD), sputum culture, and "Bronchial tree deformations can be best visualised on CT scanning."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>E. Cystic Fibrosis (CF)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> An inherited "channelopathy" caused by a defect in the "cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator" (CFTR) protein, affecting chloride transport across cell membranes.</li>
        <li><b>Genetic Basis:</b> Autosomal recessive, requiring two copies of the defective gene.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Impact of CFTR Dysfunction:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Sweat Glands:</b> Reduced chloride reabsorption, leading to "much higher sodium chloride content in sweat than normal (salty skin)."</li>
        <li><b>Lungs, Intestines, Pancreas, Liver:</b> Impaired chloride secretion and excessive sodium/water reabsorption lead to "thick secretions (bronchial and intestinal mucus, pancreatic juice, bile)."</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Clinical Consequences:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pulmonary:</b> "Dehydration of the mucus leads to defective mucociliary function, accumulation of viscid secretions, heavy colonisation of the airways by bacteria and persistent infection." This causes airflow obstruction and recurrent infections.</li>
        <li><b>Pancreatic:</b> Obstruction of ducts by viscous secretions, leading to maldigestion and malabsorption.</li>
        <li><b>Liver:</b> Blockage of bile ducts, causing cirrhosis.</li>
        <li><b>Reproductive:</b> Sterility in nearly all males due to vas deferens obstruction; decreased female fertility due to viscous cervical mucus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Diagnosis (CF):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Sweat test:</b> Confirmatory test using pilocarpine to stimulate sweating, then analyzing sweat for high sodium chloride content.</li>
        <li><b>Genetic testing:</b> Identification of CFTR mutations.</li>
        <li><b>Newborn screening:</b> Routinely performed in Australia.</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>II. Restrictive Lung Disorders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Restrictive lung disorders are characterized by "restriction of lung expansion, increased work of breathing... inadequate ventilation and impairment of gas exchange."</li>
        <li>Unlike obstructive disorders, "there is no significant wheezing as generally there is no significant airway narrowing."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Restrictive Pattern on Spirometry:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Decreased FVC and TLC (total lung capacity)."</li>
        <li>"Decreased FEV1."</li>
        <li>Crucially, "normal FEV1/FVC ratio."</li>
        <li>Flow-volume loop: "typically similar in shape to the normal one... but shrunken in all directions."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Causes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Intrinsic (Pulmonary Parenchymal Diseases):</b> Chronic inflammatory diseases affecting lung tissue, mainly interstitium, leading to widespread fibrosis and a "stiff and noncompliant lung."
            <ul>
                <li>Sarcoidosis: Chronic multisystem inflammatory disease with granulomas in lung interstitium.</li>
                <li>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF): Progressive condition of unknown cause with poor prognosis.</li>
                <li>Pneumoconioses: Caused by occupational exposure to inorganic dusts (e.g., coal, silica, asbestos).</li>
                <li>Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis: Allergic response to organic dusts.</li>
                <li>Other causes: Cancer chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, atelectasis.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Extrinsic (Extrapulmonary Diseases):</b> Conditions affecting chest wall expansion rather than the lungs directly.
            <ul>
                <li>Chest wall deformities: Kyphosis, scoliosis, pectus carinatum, pectus excavatum.</li>
                <li>Obesity.</li>
                <li>Marked ascites.</li>
                <li>Neuromuscular conditions: Poliomyelitis, muscular dystrophy, Guillain-Barré syndrome.</li>
                <li>Pleural diseases: Pleuritis, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, fibrotic pleural plaques, mesothelioma.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A. Pleuritis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "Inflammation of the pleural surfaces that typically results in characteristic pleural chest pain known as pleurodynia."</li>
        <li><b>Causes:</b> Spread of infection from lung tissue (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis), systemic autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, SLE). Often associated with inflammatory pleural effusion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Pleural Effusion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "An abnormal collection of fluid in the pleural cavity."</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Types of Fluid:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Transudate:</b> Watery fluid, poor in proteins (e.g., in left-sided heart failure, cirrhosis).</li>
        <li><b>Exudate:</b> Rich in proteins and cells, due to inflammation (e.g., in pneumonia, tuberculosis, cancer).</li>
        <li>Other types: Empyema (pus), haemothorax (blood), chylothorax (lymph).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Effect:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Acts as a "space-occupying mass; it causes a decrease in lung expansion on the affected side (restrictive lung disorder)." Can lead to atelectasis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Diagnosis (Pleural Effusion):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chest X-ray, ultrasound, CT. Treatment: Depends on cause; fluid evacuation via thoracocentesis or chest drain.</li>

    <h3>C. Pneumothorax</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "Presence of air in the pleural cavity leading to increased intrapleural pressure and partial or complete collapse of the lung (atelectasis)."</li>

                <li>Secondary: Occurs with pre-existing lung pathology (e.g., "emphysema (rupture of a subpleural bulla) – the most common cause," cystic fibrosis, severe asthma, tuberculosis, lung cancer).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Types based on air movement:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Closed:</b> Air enters from lung, may close spontaneously.</li>
        <li><b>Open:</b> Hole in chest wall, air moves in/out.</li>
        <li><b>Tension Pneumothorax:</b> A medical emergency where a "one-way valve" allows air to enter but not exit, causing "pressure in the pleural cavity keeps increasing and the heart, great vessels and trachea are shifted toward the opposite side of the chest (‘mediastinal shift’)."</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Diagnosis (Pneumothorax):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chest X-ray, CT scan (most sensitive). Treatment: Small pneumothorax may resolve spontaneously; larger ones require aspiration or chest drain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Atelectasis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> "Collapse or incomplete expansion of lung tissue at birth, or collapse of previously inflated lung tissue." The affected lung area is "devoid of air."</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Relaxation: Separation of pleural surfaces (e.g., in pneumothorax, pleural effusion).</li>
                <li>Compression: External pressure on lung tissue (e.g., tumour, enlarged lymph nodes, marked elevation of diaphragm).</li>
                <li>Adhesive: Inadequate surfactant (e.g., neonatal respiratory distress syndrome).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Obstructive:</b> Blockage of an airway leading to absorption of alveolar air.</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h2>III. Respiratory Infections</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Respiratory infections are categorized into Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs) and Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTIs).</li>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Primary TB:</b> Initial infection, often asymptomatic, leads to Ghon complex formation (initial lung lesion + lymph node involvement).</li>
                <li><b>Secondary (Reactivation) TB:</b> Occurs when primary infection is not contained or with re-exposure, localized in lung apex, causing "tissue consolidation, necrosis and cavity formation." Patients with active pulmonary TB are contagious.</li>

        <li><b>Pancoast Syndrome:</b> Cancer in lung apex causing pain, sensory deficit, paresis in arm/hand, and Horner's syndrome due to brachial plexus/sympathetic nervous system involvement.</li>
        <li><b>Paraneoplastic Syndromes:</b> Systemic effects due to tumour-secreted substances (e.g., Cushing’s syndrome, hypercalcaemia).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis (Lung Cancer):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Imaging:</b> Chest X-ray, CT, PET/CT.</li>
        <li><b>Biopsy:</b> Confirmatory, obtained via bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy for histologic examination and typing.</li>
        <li><b>Staging:</b> TNM system for NSCLC; SCLC is often assumed to have micrometastases at diagnosis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Treatment (Lung Cancer):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Depends on type and stage; surgery, radiation, chemotherapy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>V. Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Occurs when a thromboembolus, typically from a Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), travels to the pulmonary circulation and blocks a pulmonary arterial vessel. PE is often considered a complication of DVT, together forming Venous Thromboembolism (VTE).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risk Factors for DVT/PE:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Virchow's Triad:</b> Stasis of blood flow, hypercoagulability, endothelial injury.</li>
        <li>Major surgery, trauma, prolonged immobilization, malignancy, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, inherited thrombophilias.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pathophysiology:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mechanical Obstruction:</b> Embolus blocks blood flow, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and "right-sided heart failure (RHF)."</li>
        <li><b>Neurohumoral Factors:</b> Vasoconstrictors released.</li>
        <li><b>Infarction:</b> Lung tissue death can occur if blood supply is severely compromised.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clinical Presentation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Highly variable and non-specific.</li>
        <li><b>Common:</b> Dyspnoea (most common), pleuritic chest pain, tachypnoea, tachycardia.</li>
        <li><b>Massive PE:</b> Can cause acute RHF, cardiogenic shock, and death.</li>
        <li><b>Mechanisms of Pain/Dyspnoea:</b> Overstretching of pulmonary artery, RV strain, hypoxaemia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis (PE):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA):</b> "The diagnostic imaging modality of choice."</li>
        <li><b>Ventilation/Perfusion scan (V/Q scan):</b> Used when CTPA is contraindicated or inconclusive, shows "ventilated but not perfused area."</li>
        <li><b>Duplex ultrasonography of legs:</b> In search of DVT.</li>
        <li><b>ECG:</b> May show RV strain.</li>
        <li><b>D-dimer:</b> Elevated in acute thrombotic processes, has "high negative predictive value in PE."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Treatment (PE):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Anticoagulation, thrombolysis (for massive PE), embolectomy in severe cases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>VI. Respiratory Failure</h2>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Inability of the lungs to adequately perform their gas exchange functions — oxygenation of blood and elimination of carbon dioxide." Leads to hypoxaemia (low PaO2) with or without hypercapnia (increased PaCO2).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Assessment of Respiratory Function:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pulse Oximetry (SpO2):</b> Measures SaO2 (arterial haemoglobin saturation with oxygen).</li>
        <li><b>Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):</b> "Mandatory for diagnosis of respiratory failure," measures PaO2, PaCO2, pH, SaO2, HCO3, base excess/deficit.</li>
        <li><b>Venous Blood Gas (VBG):</b> Limited value, correlates well with ABG for pH and HCO3.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classification:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Type 1 (Hypoxaemic):</b> Impaired gas exchange leading to "insufficient blood oxygenation (hypoxaemia) with still sufficient carbon dioxide elimination." Occurs when not all alveolar-capillary units are affected (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, ARDS).</li>
        <li><b>Type 2 (Hypercapnic/Ventilatory):</b> "Inadequate overall alveolar ventilation leading to both hypoxaemia and hypercapnia." Occurs in conditions affecting entire ventilatory apparatus (e.g., COPD exacerbation, neuromuscular disorders).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Oxygen Therapy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Administered to maintain SaO2 ≥ 90%.</li>
        <li><b>Caution with CO2 Retainers (e.g., COPD patients):</b> Oxygen can worsen hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis due to blunted hypoxic drive and V/Q mismatch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ventilatory Support:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Non-invasive:</b> CPAP, BiPAP.</li>
        <li><b>Invasive:</b> Mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube or tracheostomy.</li>
    </ul>
