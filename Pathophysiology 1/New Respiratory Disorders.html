                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Anatomy and Physiology of the Respiratory System</h2>
                <div class="assessment-box">
                    <h3>Anatomy of the Lungs</h3>
                    <p>The respiratory system is divided into the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The <strong>upper tract</strong> includes the nose, pharynx, and larynx, which warm, filter, and humidify incoming air. The <strong>lower tract</strong> begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi, bronchioles, and finally the alveoli.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                        <li><strong>Trachea & Bronchi:</strong> Rigid airways supported by cartilage that conduct air to the lungs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bronchioles:</strong> Smaller airways without cartilage, whose diameter is controlled by smooth muscle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Alveoli:</strong> The terminal air sacs where gas exchange occurs. They are thin-walled and surrounded by a dense network of pulmonary capillaries.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="assessment-box">
                    <h3>Physiology of Breathing (Ventilation)</h3>
                    <p>Breathing is the mechanical process of moving air in and out of the lungs.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                        <li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> An active process where the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles contract, increasing thoracic volume and creating negative pressure that draws air into the lungs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Expiration:</strong> A largely passive process where the muscles relax, and the elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall pushes air out. Forced expiration is an active process involving abdominal and internal intercostal muscles.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Gas Exchange (Respiration)</strong> occurs via diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane, driven by partial pressure gradients of oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>

                <p>Characterized by increased resistance to airflow due to airway narrowing. This makes expiration, particularly forced expiration, difficult and prolonged.</p>

                    <h3>Spirometry Findings in Obstructive Disease</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                        <li><strong>Reduced FEV₁:</strong> The volume of air exhaled in the first second is significantly decreased.</li>
                        <li><strong>Normal or Reduced FVC:</strong> The total volume of air exhaled may be normal or reduced due to air trapping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced FEV₁/FVC Ratio (<70%):</strong> This is the hallmark of obstruction. The proportion of air exhaled in the first second is disproportionately low.</li>
                        <li><strong>Concave "scooped out" Flow-Volume Loop.</strong></li>

                <h3 id="asthma">Asthma</h3>
                <div class="disorder-box">
                    <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> A chronic inflammatory disorder causing bronchial hyper-responsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction. It involves bronchospasm, mucosal edema, and mucus plugging. Allergic (extrinsic) asthma is a Type I hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgE antibodies, which bind to mast cells. Upon re-exposure to an allergen, mast cells degranulate, releasing histamine and other mediators that cause acute bronchoconstriction and inflammation.</p>

                <h3 id="copd">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</h3>
                <div class="disorder-box">
                    <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> A progressive disease, mainly caused by smoking, encompassing two conditions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Chronic Bronchitis ("Blue Bloater"):</strong> Defined by a clinical history of productive cough. Characterized by inflammation of the airways, hypertrophy of mucus glands, and mucus hypersecretion, leading to airway obstruction. Hypoxic vasoconstriction leads to pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure (cor pulmonale), causing cyanosis and peripheral edema.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emphysema ("Pink Puffer"):</strong> Characterized by the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to the formation of large, abnormal airspaces. This loss of elastic tissue reduces the lung's recoil, causing air trapping and expiratory airway collapse. Patients often use pursed-lip breathing to maintain airway pressure and remain non-cyanotic ("pink") until late stages.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <h3 id="bronchiectasis">Bronchiectasis</h3>
                <div class="disorder-box">
                    <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> A condition of localized, irreversible dilation of parts of the bronchial tree, caused by destruction of the muscle and elastic tissue in the airway walls. This is typically the result of chronic or recurrent severe infections. The dilated airways allow mucus to pool, leading to a cycle of further infection and inflammation.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 id="cf">Cystic Fibrosis (CF)</h3>
                <div class="disorder-box">
                    <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> An autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. This leads to a defective chloride ion channel, resulting in abnormally thick, viscous secretions in multiple organs. In the lungs, this thick mucus impairs mucociliary clearance, leading to airway obstruction, chronic bacterial infections, and progressive bronchiectasis.</p>

                    <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
                    <p>Obstruction of a pulmonary artery by an embolus, most commonly a thrombus that has dislodged from a deep vein in the leg (DVT). The obstruction prevents blood flow to a section of the lung, creating <strong>alveolar dead space</strong> (an area that is ventilated but not perfused). This leads to a profound V/Q mismatch and hypoxemia. A large PE increases pulmonary vascular resistance, causing acute right ventricular strain and potentially obstructive shock.</p>

                <div class="assessment-box">
                    <h3>Clinical Presentation and Management</h3>
                    <p><strong>Presentation:</strong> The classic triad is sudden onset of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and haemoptysis, but this is uncommon. More often, the presentation is non-specific, with unexplained dyspnea and tachycardia being the most common signs. A high index of suspicion is crucial, especially in patients with risk factors for DVT.</p>
                    <p><strong>Management:</strong> High-flow oxygen is the primary treatment to manage hypoxemia. In haemodynamically unstable patients (obstructive shock), provide supportive care with cautious fluid administration and prepare for potential cardiac arrest. Rapid transport to a hospital with capabilities for thrombolysis or embolectomy is essential.</p>
