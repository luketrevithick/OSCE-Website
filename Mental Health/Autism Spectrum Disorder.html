They explain their son, who has ASD, is having a "meltdown". You hear loud vocalizations (e.g., repetitive sounds, shouting) from a bedroom. The parent leads you towards the room, explaining he's overwhelmed and won't let them near. Peeking into the room, you see the patient pacing rapidly, flapping his hands, and occasionally hitting his head lightly against the wall. The room has posters on the wall, several objects on shelves, and fluorescent lighting.</p>

                <li><strong>Prioritize Safety (Patient and Crew):** Maintain safe distance initially. Assess environmental hazards. Await police if behaviour escalates or poses significant risk. Ensure clear exit path.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Modification:</strong> Reduce sensory input: Dim lights, reduce noise (turn off radios, speak quietly), minimize number of people present, remove clutter if possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication Strategy:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li>Use calm, quiet, simple, direct language. Avoid jargon or complex sentences. Allow processing time.</li>
                        <li>Use visual aids (PECS, written words) if known to be helpful (ask carer).</li>
                        <li>Approach slowly, avoid sudden movements or direct sustained eye contact initially.</li>
                        <li>Communicate primarily with carer initially to gather information and understand patient's needs/communication style.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>Involve Carer/Parent:</strong> Ask carer about known triggers, successful de-escalation strategies, communication preferences, and baseline behaviour. Empower carer to assist if safe and appropriate.</li>
                 <li><strong>De-escalation Techniques:</strong> Focus on reducing arousal and providing sense of safety. Offer space. Use distraction with preferred items/topics (ask carer) once initial agitation subsides slightly. Validate distress non-verbally (calm presence).</li>
                 <li><strong>Physical Assessment:</strong> Limit hands-on assessment until patient is calmer, unless immediate life threats suspected. Explain intended actions simply before touching. Assess for injury from self-harm or underlying medical cause for distress.</li>
                 <li><strong>Pharmacological Intervention (Sedation):</strong> Generally a last resort. Consider only for severe, prolonged agitation posing significant risk despite environmental modification and de-escalation, following local protocols and preferably after consultation/police arrival. Use agents appropriate for behavioural disturbance (e.g., IM Midazolam, Droperidol - check protocols).</li>
                 <li><strong>Transport Decision:</strong> Transport to ED is likely necessary for assessment, especially if distress is severe, prolonged, involves significant self-injury, or if underlying medical cause suspected. Discuss with carer. Transport can be highly stressful; plan carefully (minimize sensory input, allow carer presence, consider pre-notification).</li>
                <li><strong>Teamwork & Communication:</strong> Maintain calm communication between crew members. Liaise with police if present. Clear handover to ED, highlighting ASD diagnosis, triggers, effective strategies, communication needs, and reason for presentation.</li>
